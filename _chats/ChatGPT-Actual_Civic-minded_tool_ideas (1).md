# Actual Civic-minded tool ideas

#### You:
Take a look at ActualJobs/ActualNews and ContingencyNote and play around with other alternative/supporting useful tools, especially simple 'saas-likes', we can ship fairly quickly that offer value to regular people alongside the main BBB offering. Not too interested in money, but a little wouldn't hurt, more want to replace toxic/bad systems with positive/helpful/civic-minded ones, especially around common problems faced by (primary focus on British, but western/global are fine) people. Think anything where people are bombarded by scams, friction, dark patterns or other problems to simply do something easy, but nobody is doing it for free (either ever, or anymore).

Really think about it please

#### ChatGPT:
love this brief. here’s a menu of small, shippable “saas-likes” that fit BBB’s vibe: low-friction, pro-user, civic-minded, and designed to sand away the dark patterns people trip over every day—especially in the UK.

# quick-ship tool ideas (each with an MVP you can build without a big team)

### 1) Subscrub — clean cancellations & cooling-off helper

- **Problem:** companies hide cancel paths, run retention gauntlets, bury cooling-off rights.
- **MVP:** paste a merchant name → get the *fastest legal way to exit* (channels, opening hours, exact words), an auto-filled cancellation email/letter, and a checklist for cooling-off/early-termination fees.
- **Why BBB:** turns consumer rights into one-click actions. Great on mobile.

### 2) FairRefund — rights-based complaint & refund letter pack

- **Problem:** people don’t know the phrases that unlock refunds/repairs (Consumer Rights Act, travel delay comp, chargebacks).
- **MVP:** wizard → outputs a plain-English letter + a “legalese booster” paragraph, plus send-by-post/email options and escalation path (ombudsman routes).
- **Edge:** opinionated templates, not generic waffle. “Say this, in this order.”

### 3) CookieCutter — auto-decline dark-pattern cookies (browser extension)

- **Problem:** reject flows are intentionally tedious; most users give up.
- **MVP:** quietly finds “reject all” and clicks it, or auto-configures the most private allowed state; keeps a site scorecard.
- **Edge:** totally free, privacy-first; public leaderboard of worst offenders.

### 4) Junk Fee Radar — “true price” highlighter for checkout pages

- **Problem:** drip pricing & add-ons (booking fees, service charges, mystery insurance).
- **MVP (extension):** reads the basket, flags junk fees, shows “last clean price” and common removal tricks (e.g., *untick X on step 3*).
- **Edge:** names and shames patterns; lets users submit screenshots to improve it.

### 5) Parking Ticket Triage (PCN helper)

- **Problem:** PCNs are intentionally confusing; many are winnable on technicalities.
- **MVP:** upload photos/PCN details → quick triage (“appeal likely / pay early”), with tailored appeal letter and evidence checklist (signage, lines, camera calibration).
- **Edge:** saves ordinary people time & money; clear disclaimers (not legal advice).

### 6) DepositShield — tenancy deposit & deductions pack

- **Problem:** unlawful deductions + confusion over deposit schemes and deadlines.
- **MVP:** enter tenancy dates, deposit amount, scheme (if known) → validity check, pre-action letter, evidence pack template, and timeline calculator for disputes.
- **Edge:** practical, de-escalatory, but firm. Works for England/Wales out of the gate.

### 7) RentRise Checker — is my rent increase lawful?

- **Problem:** opaque section 13 notices, frequency/timing rules, local comparables.
- **MVP:** parse notice details → sanity check (form, timing, % jump), produce polite counter-offer letter with comparable-rent evidence scaffold.
- **Edge:** reduces conflict; empowers tenants without promising miracles.

### 8) Energy Sanity Check — tariff & usage plain-Englisher

- **Problem:** unit rates vs standing charges confuse people; “fixes” vs caps, exit fees.
- **MVP:** upload last bill or type numbers → clean breakdown, “what’s normal for you”, red flags (phantom usage, misreads), and a script for supplier calls.
- **Edge:** interprets, doesn’t sell. Trust first.

### 9) Council Tax Aid Wizard — discounts & challenge kit

- **Problem:** many miss single-person discounts, band challenges, exemptions.
- **MVP:** simple flow → likely entitlements + pre-filled council email/letter, evidence list, and reminder schedule for follow-up.
- **Edge:** measurable financial wins for households.

### 10) Travel Delay Fix — train/flight comp navigator

- **Problem:** scattered rules, form fatigue, deliberate friction.
- **MVP:** select journey & delay → one output: the right claim form link + pre-filled text and receipts checklist; tracks statutory time limits.
- **Edge:** fast dopamine hit; pairs nicely with ActualNews travel disruption alerts.

### 11) FOI / SAR Copilot — get your data, get the facts

- **Problem:** people don’t know how to write Subject Access Requests or FOIs that get results.
- **MVP:** two wizards producing tight, scope-limited requests, plus tracking calendar and escalation templates.
- **Edge:** civic power tool; fuels journalism and personal admin.

### 12) Bank-Statement Subscription Sweep (read-only)

- **Problem:** small recurring charges hide in the noise.
- **MVP:** CSV upload (or email receipts import) → groups likely subs, marks free trials nearing charge, suggests action via Subscrub.
- **Edge:** no Open Banking needed for v1 (but can be added later).

### 13) ActualJobs Guard — scam & junk job filter

- **Problem:** ghost roles, recruiter spam, scraped duplicates, pay cloaking.
- **MVP:** scoring model for postings (signals: salary opacity, domain age, recruiter patterns), with explain-why flags and “report listing” button.
- **Edge:** slots neatly beside ActualJobs; maintains a public trust score.

### 14) ActualNews Verify — claim checker + reading mode

- **Problem:** headlines overheat; subtle misquotes spread.
- **MVP:** paste a claim/link → get a distilled “what’s new / what’s known / what’s unknown,” with semantic deduping of articles and source diversity prompts.
- **Edge:** complements ActualNews; great for sharing into group chats.

### 15) NHS Registration Finder & Alert (GP/dentist)

- **Problem:** “not taking new patients” dead ends.
- **MVP:** user picks a radius and practice types → we monitor public pages for “accepting new patients” phrasing and ping when status flips; provides scripts for calling.
- **Edge:** community-powered corrections; zero scalping.

### 16) NoticeNinja — contract notice & penalty sanity checker

- **Problem:** notice periods, minimum terms, ETF traps are intentionally murky.
- **MVP:** upload a contract snippet → highlights notice clauses in plain English and suggests a compliant exit plan.
- **Edge:** focus on interpretation, not legal counsel.

### 17) Housing Disrepair Pack

- **Problem:** people live with unsafe conditions because the process is daunting.
- **MVP:** step-by-step evidence capture (photos, dates), pre-action protocol letter, and calm escalation path.
- **Edge:** humane, trauma-aware tone; prevents needless adversarial spirals.

### 18) Junk-Call & Text Reporter

- **Problem:** spam/scam calls/texts waste time & risk harm.
- **MVP:** one-tap report with number/message; creates a crowd-sourced live blocklist and “what they’re trying now” briefings.
- **Edge:** communal early-warning radar for scams.

# prioritised shortlist (impact × feasibility × BBB fit)

1. **Subscrub**
2. **FairRefund**
3. **Parking Ticket Triage**
4. **DepositShield**
5. **Council Tax Aid Wizard**
6. **CookieCutter**
7. **Travel Delay Fix**
8. **ActualJobs Guard**

These give quick, tangible wins (cancel successfully; get money back; avoid unfair fines; claim entitlements) and dovetail with ActualNews/ActualJobs.

---

# how they plug into ActualJobs / ActualNews / ContingencyNote

- **ActualJobs ↔ ActualJobs Guard & Subscrub:** filter junk roles; one-click unsubscribe from recruiter spam; surface transparent-pay employers.
- **ActualNews ↔ Verify & Travel Delay Fix:** news events become *actions* (e.g., rail strikes → claim pack).
- **ContingencyNote ↔ DepositShield/Housing Disrepair/FOI & SAR:** life-admin vault that stores letters/evidence and reminds you about statutory deadlines, ready to hand to a trusted person if needed.

---

# opinionated product principles (your “BBB seal”)

- **No upsells, no affiliate nudges** inside flows that advise users.
- **Explainability over magic:** show the *why* behind decisions (signals, statutes, guidance).
- **Public bad-actor scoreboards:** shine light on dark patterns; let users contribute evidence.
- **Data-minimised by default:** local processing where possible; redact on upload; short retention windows.
- **Civic APIs:** publish anonymised patterns so others can build pro-user tools too.

---

# build notes (to keep MVPs lightweight)

- **UX:** single-page flows; “paste or upload → result”; save outputs as PDFs.
- **Engines:**
  - Text extraction (contracts/bills/PCNs): Tesseract + rule-based parsers before any ML.
  - Letter generation: deterministic templates with small LLM fills for tone, never hallucinating statutes.
  - Browser extensions: vanilla content scripts; zero permissions creep.
- **Community loop:** lightweight “was this useful?” and “share a screenshot” to continuously harden rules.
- **Guardrails:** bright disclaimers (“information, not legal advice”), jurisdiction toggles, and links to official routes.

---

# sample flows (to show the vibe)

**Parking Ticket Triage**

1. Upload PCN photo → 2) Enter date/time/location → 3) We check signage/timeline basics → 4) Output: “appeal likely” with a ready letter + evidence list, or “pay within 14 days to save £X.”

**Subscrub**

1. Type “GymCo” → 2) We show: cancellation email, postal address, phone script, cooling-off eligibility → 3) One click to copy/send; optional reminder to verify the confirmation.

**Council Tax Aid Wizard**

1. Address & household makeup → 2) Likely discounts + band challenge feasibility → 3) Pre-filled email to the right council mailbox + doc checklist.

---

# what this replaces (the “anti-toxic” lens)

- Maze-like cancellation paths → **Subscrub** gives direct exits.
- Legalese walls → **FairRefund** & **DepositShield** produce precise, respectful letters.
- Nudge-ridden web → **CookieCutter** & **Junk Fee Radar** neutralise dark patterns.
- Scattered civic routes → **FOI/SAR Copilot** makes transparency routine.

---

If you want, I’ll pick one (say Subscrub or Parking Ticket Triage) and draft the exact screens, copy, and template library so you can feel the whole experience end-to-end.


#### You:
Some more complicated tools I considered, that rely on the same or similar tech to ActualNews/ActualJobs were ActualDating (tinder/plentyoffish), ActualFamily (simple group chats, just send a link, lose a device you have to ask for a new invite, mainly security by obscurity which has its problems, might need a passphrase to unlock shared key), ActualNeighbours/ActualStreet (NextDoor) and ActualEvents (kinda my meetup idea where you drop live beacons on a map for current/ongoing/past or future events).

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — so you’re thinking of a *second layer* of BBB tools, closer to full “platforms” than single-purpose utilities like **Subscrub** or **Parking Ticket Triage**. These bigger bets all riff on the same core themes we’ve been circling: stripping away dark-patterns, heavy ad-tracking, and predatory incentives, replacing them with “good-faith civic infrastructure.” Let me break down the ones you listed, what they’d look like in an “Actual-flavoured” way, and what the complexity/payoff trade-offs are:

---

## **1. ActualDating** (alt-Tinder/POF)

- **Problem with incumbents:** endless swipe loops, opaque algorithms, paywalls for basic features, addictive mechanics rather than meaningful connections.
- **BBB spin:**
  - *No infinite scroll / no “hot or not” swiping.* Instead: slower, considered introductions, maybe limited daily matches.
  - *Trust layer:* match recommendations weighted by community-based trust, not by who paid for “boosts.”
  - *Consent first:* built-in “safe exit” (easy block, report, or fade-out) with transparent rules.
  - *Transparency:* algorithm settings visible and tweakable (e.g. “show me more locals / more common interests”).
- **Complication:** high moderation burden (fake profiles, harassment, safety). Needs sustainable model (subscription? donations? partnerships with civic orgs?). Higher build + community overhead.

---

## **2. ActualFamily** (secure micro-group messaging)

- **Problem with incumbents:** WhatsApp/FB Messenger lock-in, ads, metadata mining, opaque group ownership.
- **BBB spin:**
  - *Invite-only links with rotating keys.* Families/friend groups own their data.
  - *Security by obscurity + optional passphrase.* Lose a phone → ask group for re-invite.
  - *No algorithmic feeds.* Just chronological group chat with light features (shared calendar, grocery list, photos).
  - *Self-hosted / client-side crypto.* Could piggyback on the ContingencyNote tech for secure shared stores.
- **Complication:** once you step into “secure chat,” you’re competing with Signal/WhatsApp/Telegram. The edge would be *simplicity and trustworthiness for non-technical family groups* — “grandparent-proof secure family hub.”

---

## **3. ActualNeighbours / ActualStreet** (alt-Nextdoor)

- **Problem with incumbents:** Nextdoor is toxic, full of surveillance, racist “suspicious person” posts, and advertiser pressure.
- **BBB spin:**
  - *Street-sized groups, not whole suburbs.* Keep scope small and human.
  - *No ad incentives, no growth hacking.* Purely local bulletin board for “need a ladder / found a cat / who wants to chip in for a skip?”
  - *Optional “civic mode”:* link directly to council services, local mutual aid, planning consultations.
  - *Transparency:* no dark patterns, clear moderation, community ownership.
- **Complication:** seeding network effects is hard. Needs very simple onboarding (maybe “stick a QR code on the lamppost, join this street”). Could double as a “hyperlocal emergency coordination” tool — fits well with **ContingencyNote** ethos.

---

## **4. ActualEvents** (alt-Meetup/Eventbrite)

- **Problem with incumbents:** paywalls for organisers, spam, lots of dead groups, RSVP harvesting.
- **BBB spin:**
  - *Map-first interface:* drop a beacon where you are, set “now / later / recurring.”
  - *Ephemeral by default:* events can vanish after they end, minimising data collection.
  - *Open discovery:* filter by interest tags, distance, accessibility.
  - *No platform lock-in:* events exportable as standard calendar/ICS feeds.
- **Complication:** moderation + safety. How to stop spam / dodgy events without armies of moderators? Could lean on community trust scores (ActualNews/Jobs integration).

---

### How they connect to the BBB ecosystem

- **Shared trust layer:** the same reputation system across Jobs, News, Neighbours, Dating → one “civic trust score.”
- **Shared privacy posture:** no ads, no third-party trackers, open data where safe.
- **ContingencyNote integration:** families/streets could use the secure vault to share docs (e.g. neighbourhood watch rotas, emergency contacts).
- **Events integration:** local meetups & civic events automatically surface in **ActualNews** feeds.

---

### Complexity vs impact

- **High complexity / high impact:** *ActualDating* and *ActualNeighbours* could be genuinely transformative but are heavy to build + moderate.
- **Medium complexity / medium-high impact:** *ActualEvents* is less moderation-heavy (since events are ephemeral, not long-lived communities) and could be bootstrapped with simple map + form + ICS export.
- **Medium complexity / medium impact:** *ActualFamily* is simpler technically (secure group chats) but competes with mature apps, so adoption depends on “trust over features.”

---

✅ **Near-term candidates for BBB** (realistic to ship & aligned with your “civic alternative” ethos):

- **ActualEvents** → because we can piggyback on your mapping/graph work, and it’s action-oriented (like ActualNews → ActualAction).
- **ActualNeighbours/Street** → pairs beautifully with BBB’s “responsibility graph” idea, but moderation is the big design challenge.
- **ActualFamily** could almost be a thin layer atop your existing **ContingencyNote** tech (shared vault → chat & calendar).

❌ **ActualDating** feels like a whole startup in itself — maybe a “someday/maybe,” or partner with existing ethical dating apps instead of reinventing.

---

👉 Would you like me to sketch **what an MVP of ActualEvents** could look like (screen flow, tech stack, and moderation approach)? That one feels like the lowest-hanging “bigger” idea that’s doable without turning into a multi-year social network build.


#### You:
Another useful tool might be ActualFeedback, where any business (or say event organiser, or social enterprise or basically anything) can set a public profile, with a public url. Any user/visitor can use that link to submit feedback. The signing and local-device memory let's the feedback provider edit their feedback on that device, so it's slightly ephemeral, and losing a key doesn't _really_ matter, but the org/owner/etc gets feedback (signed and private) and, if the content is safe, can choose to expose it publicly (optional, and configurable by both participants, not just by a flag, but by the method of encryption that controls directionality and required signers).

This lets both temporary (event) feedback and permanent feedback (say for a doctor practice or a shop or farm) and feedback is submitted with full control of both parties. This has some limitations for 'reviews', since an owner can always delete content published below their root, but maybe we don't need 'reviews', but instead focus on making it an easy way for customers/clients/patients to provide information to an org to determine better outcomes, but in a way that lets them explain personal complaints safely (unlike say google reviews which are always open, so patients have to know not to share specific medical details, or customers have to know not to include order numbers/dates/etc). 

#### ChatGPT:
That’s a really sharp idea — **ActualFeedback** feels like it could hit a sweet spot between *trustworthy reviews* and *safe, private feedback loops*. The key innovation here is that you’re not trying to “out-Google Google Reviews,” but instead to **flip the power balance**: give people a way to share experiences and complaints safely, while letting organisations choose how to engage/respond without everything being permanently public by default.

Here’s a structured breakdown:

---

## **ActualFeedback — “Feedback with dignity”**

### 🎯 Problem it solves

- **Current review platforms are hostile by design:**
  - Reviews are permanent, performative, and mined for ad/SEO value.
  - Customers often overshare (order numbers, health data, identifiable info) because the only feedback channel is public.
  - Businesses are stuck: they can’t remove unsafe disclosures without nuking the whole review, but they *can* abuse takedowns to silence criticism.

### 🟢 BBB-style solution

- **Public profile, private channel:**
  - Any org/social enterprise/event creates a simple public URL (“actualfeedback.uk/yourshop”).
  - Visitors can leave feedback via a clean form — *signed locally* so they can revisit and edit/delete their submission from the same device.
  - Feedback is private to the org by default.

- **Selective public exposure:**
  - Org can choose to publish feedback if *both sides* cryptographically consent (e.g. feedbacker’s key + org’s key).
  - If one side disagrees, it stays private.
  - This ensures personal/sensitive info doesn’t end up in public by accident, and also avoids fake reviews dominating.

- **Ephemeral safety net:**
  - If you lose your local key/device, you lose the ability to edit — but that’s okay, since it’s not permanent reputation graffiti.
  - Keeps the barrier low for casual event feedback.

### ✨ Value props

- For **users/customers**:
  - A safe place to share complaints or praise without oversharing in public.
  - Confidence their info won’t be data-mined or weaponised.
  - Can see if/when their feedback was acknowledged.

- For **organisations**:
  - No SEO hit from angry rants.
  - Channel for meaningful feedback → improve services.
  - Option to publish positive feedback (but only with consent, so trust is higher when shown).
  - Works for permanent profiles (shop, GP practice, charity) *and* temporary ones (events, pop-ups).

### 🔐 Trust & governance

- **Encryption & signatures:** ensures provenance (orgs know a message really came from *this* visitor) without forcing identity disclosure.
- **Moderation is local:** orgs can decide what to publish, but can’t fabricate content because feedback is signed and verifiable.
- **Transparency ledger:** optional — orgs can choose to publish a verifiable log of all feedback submissions (without content), proving they don’t just “disappear” negatives.

### ⚙️ MVP build path

1. **Step 1: Core feedback form**
   - One-click setup for org → generates unique public link.
   - Visitors submit feedback, gets signed + stored.
   - Org dashboard shows private inbox.

2. **Step 2: Local device key memory**
   - Lightweight localStorage-based key pair → user can edit/delete their feedback from same browser/device.
   - No central account required.

3. **Step 3: Optional publishing**
   - Org can request consent to publish → user gets a one-tap “yes/no” prompt via local key.
   - Public profile shows published items.

4. **Step 4: Civic/communal add-ons**
   - Categories for sectors (shops, doctors, events, services).
   - “Civic routes” built-in: if complaint is about landlord, you can forward to council; if about energy firm, to Ombudsman.
   - Aggregate dashboards (anonymised stats like “Top 10 issues raised with councils this quarter”).

### 🛠 Tech

- **Frontend:** SPA (React + Tailwind, same as your other tools).
- **Backend:** minimal — stores encrypted blobs + org profiles.
- **Crypto:** WebCrypto API for local keypair generation + signing.
- **Identity:** none required by default; optional verified accounts for orgs.

### 🚀 Why it fits BBB

- Reinforces the theme: *tools that rebalance power away from extractive, toxic systems.*
- Could tie into **ActualNews** (e.g. surfacing anonymised trends: “50% of feedback about GP access this month mentions wait times”).
- Could tie into **ContingencyNote** (feedback stored in your civic vault; can delegate editing rights to trusted people).

---

👉 Two questions for you:

1. Do you see **ActualFeedback** as mainly *private improvement channel* (org hears you, but not public), or more of a *trusted review platform* (orgs publish with consent)?
2. Should I sketch an **MVP flow** (screens, data structure, how the signing/editing works in practice), like I offered with **ActualEvents** — so you can see what a shippable v1 looks like?


#### You:
It's not really 'reviews' it's definitely feedback. A 'safe' way of telling a business/org/etc about your experience. Not trustpilot, but whatever that service is that asks you to help by answering a survey. We could even use a simple org-controlled schema to ask for structured information, or to use for running research (feedback, not reviews)

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — that clarification helps a lot.\
So **ActualFeedback** isn’t meant to be a *review platform* at all (no stars, no public ratings war). It’s more like a **safe civic-grade “tell us how it went” channel** — structured where useful, ephemeral for the user, private by default, and publishable only if both sides agree.

Here’s how it could look if we lean hard into *feedback-as-utility* rather than *reviews-as-reputation*:

---

## **ActualFeedback — Private, Structured, Safe**

### 🎯 Core concept

- Think of it as **“a civic-grade Typeform/SurveyMonkey, but for *feedback*, not marketing.”**
- Organisation sets up a profile → can design a simple schema (custom fields: multiple choice, sliders, free-text).
- Visitors use the public link to fill it in.
- Responses are **signed & editable** locally (so you can fix mistakes without logging in).
- Org gets the data in a safe, GDPR-friendly way — no scraping, no SEO theatre.

---

### 🔐 Safety / Trust

- **Private by default:** your complaint/feedback goes straight to the org. It’s not on Google.
- **Ephemeral editing:** your local key lets you update/delete; lose it and your message just “freezes.”
- **Consentful publishing:** if org wants to make feedback public (say, positive testimonials), both sides must agree cryptographically.
- **Sensitive info filter:** automatic nudge if you try to enter data that looks like personal identifiers (“this looks like an NHS number — are you sure?”).

---

### 🛠 MVP build path

**Phase 1: Lightweight Survey-Feedback Tool**

- Org registers → creates profile + feedback form (pick from a few templates: *customer service, event feedback, patient visit, research survey*).
- Gets unique public link (e.g. `actualfeedback.uk/orgname`).
- User fills form → generates signed blob → stored encrypted on server.
- Org has a simple inbox with results.

**Phase 2: Local Editing & Consent-to-Publish**

- User’s device remembers key → lets them revisit and edit/delete.
- Org can ping a “publish request” → user gets one-tap approve/decline.

**Phase 3: Research / structured data**

- Org can design schema (e.g. Likert scales, multiple choice).
- Export CSV/JSON for research or internal dashboards.
- Optional *aggregate publishing* (org can show “80% of patients waited <15 mins” without exposing individual responses).

---

### ✨ Value props

- **For users:**
  - Safer than leaving a review — no pressure, no data leaks.
  - Can edit or retract easily.
  - More likely to be *heard* (since orgs actually receive and act on it).

- **For organisations:**
  - Cheap/free alternative to SurveyMonkey, Typeform, Medallia etc.
  - Legally safer: less chance of GDPR breaches from over-sharing.
  - Can still use positive feedback publicly, but with integrity.
  - Useful for research projects (social enterprises, councils, charities).

---

### 🌍 BBB ecosystem tie-ins

- **ActualNews:** events covered could have embedded feedback links (“Tell us your experience of the rail strikes here → data goes to both BBB research + rail operators”).
- **ActualEvents:** every event beacon could include an auto-generated ActualFeedback form.
- **ActualNeighbours/Street:** local councils could drop feedback forms for consultations directly into the community hub.
- **ContingencyNote:** stores your submitted feedback + replies in your civic vault, so you keep a personal record of complaints/surveys you’ve filed.

---

This feels like it hits your criteria **exactly**:

- Replaces dark-pattern survey/review systems.
- Provides clear civic value.
- Technically shippable (feedback forms + encryption + local signing = 3–4 sprints MVP).
- Scales from *tiny events* to *national consultations*.

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch **a concrete MVP flow for ActualFeedback** (like I did with Subscrub/Parking Triage), showing screens for:

1. Org setup → schema builder.
2. User feedback form + safe-submit.
3. Org inbox + publish-with-consent flow.

That’d give you a feel for how it could look live.


#### You:
No registration, for anyone. Org is also run from a key. 'Signup' makes a new key and tells you to store it safely, 'Login' asks for your key.

#### ChatGPT:
love it — **key-only, no registration** is super on-brand. Here’s a concrete, shippable blueprint for **ActualFeedback** with orgs and users both operating from local keys, plus how editing, publishing consent, and structured schemas work without accounts.

# ActualFeedback — key-first, zero-registration MVP

## Core principles

- **No accounts.** Everyone = a keypair. “Sign up” = generate key. “Log in” = paste/scan/import key.
- **Private-by-default.** Submissions go only to the org (encrypted to the org’s public key).
- **Local editing.** The sender can edit/withdraw from the same device using their local key.
- **Two-key publishing.** Anything public requires **both** the sender and org to co-sign (dual-consent).
- **Org-defined schema.** Lightweight, local schema editor for structured feedback and research.

---

## UX at a glance

### Org flow (no registration)

1. **Create org** → “Generate key” → shows `Org Private Key` + `Org Public Key` and a **shareable link**:\
   `actualfeedback.uk/#/o/<ORG_PUBKEY_FP>`
   - Prominent: “Save your private key. Lose it = lose control.”
   - Offer quick backups: **download .key file**, **copy**, **QR**, optional **passphrase-encrypted** file.

2. **Build form** (optional structure)
   - Start with a default: `topic (short)`, `what happened? (long)`, `when/where`, `attachments`, `contact (optional)`.
   - Schema editor supports: short text, long text, select, multiselect, number, date/time, boolean, sliders.
   - Add **privacy nudges** (“This looks like personal medical data—are you sure?”).

3. **Get public link** to accept feedback
   - Example: `actualfeedback.uk/<ORG_HANDLE>` maps internally to the org’s **public key** (handle is an alias bound to the key by a signed name record).
   - Anyone can submit; everything is E2E encrypted to the org.

4. **View inbox** (client-side decryption)
   - Paste/import private key → decrypt submissions locally in the browser.
   - Actions per submission: **acknowledge**, **reply (optional)**, **request publish consent**, **export CSV/JSON**.
   - “Research view” aggregates structured fields (charts are all client-side).

5. **Request publish** (optional)
   - Click “Ask to publish” → sender receives a **publish-consent prompt** on their device (if still present) or via a **consent link** bound to their submission key.
   - Only becomes public if **both signatures** present.

---

### User (feedback sender) flow

1. Open org’s link → instant form (no login).
2. **Generate sender key** on submit (if you don’t have one).
   - Stored in `localStorage` (or WebCrypto keystore) with a **local nickname**.
   - Prompt to **export** the key (file/QR) if they want control across devices.
3. **Safe submit:**
   - Client encrypts payload to **Org Public Key**.
   - Client signs payload hash with **Sender Private Key** (so org can verify provenance, not identity).
4. After submit, they see “Your feedback was received” + a **local edit link** bound to their key.
5. They can **edit/withdraw** from the same device (re-encrypt + re-sign). Losing the key/device simply freezes the state (acceptable by design).
6. If org asks to publish, they’ll see a **consent prompt**; “Agree” signs a **publish grant** that does **not** reveal extra data.

---

## Crypto + data model (clean and minimal)

### Keys

- Ed25519 (signing) + X25519 (encryption) derived from a single seed (libs like tweetnacl / libsodium).
- Represent the **private key** in a user-friendly armored format (Base58Check + checksum).
- **Public key fingerprint** = short stable ID (shows in URLs, QR codes).

### Submissions (stored server-side)

```json
{
  "submission_id": "uuid-v4",
  "org_pub": "base58-public-key",
  "sender_pub": "base58-public-key",
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "ciphertext": "sealed-box(x25519) ...",   // includes form fields + attachments (chunked)
  "sender_sig": "ed25519(sig(hash(plaintext)))",
  "created_at": 1690000000,
  "updated_at": 1690000500,
  "status": "private|withdrawn|publish_requested|published",
  "publish": {
    "org_pub_sig": "ed25519(sig(hash(public_excerpt)))|null",
    "sender_pub_sig": "ed25519(sig(hash(public_excerpt)))|null",
    "public_excerpt": { /* optional redacted/structured subset agreed for publication */ }
  }
}
```

- The **server never sees plaintext**; inbox decryption happens client-side with the org’s private key.
- **Public excerpts** are a **separate signed object**, not just “toggle visibility.” Both sides sign the **exact bytes** to be public.

### Schema objects

```json
{
  "schema_id": "uuid",
  "org_pub": "base58-public-key",
  "title": "Event Feedback (Short)",
  "fields": [
    {"id": "experience", "type": "longtext", "label": "How did it go?"},
    {"id": "wait_time", "type": "number", "label": "Wait time (mins)", "min":0, "max":300},
    {"id": "staff_helpful", "type": "likert", "label": "Staff were helpful", "scale":5},
    {"id": "contact_email", "type": "email", "label": "Reply to me (optional)", "optional": true}
  ],
  "data_use": "Research and service improvement; no resale; retained 12 months",
  "retention_days": 365,
  "signed_by_org": "ed25519(sig(hash(schema_json)))",
  "version": 3
}
```

- Org “publishes” schemas (signed), so senders can verify what they’re filling is the org’s intent.

---

## Publishing with dual consent (directional encryption)

- **Private channel:** content encrypted to **org** only.
- **Public excerpt:** a **new JSON object** containing only the fields both sides want to share.
- Flow:
  1. Org composes a **proposed excerpt** (may redact personal bits).
  2. Org signs it → **sender sees the diff** vs original plaintext (client remembers their plaintext) and either **co-signs** or declines.
  3. Server stores the **co-signed excerpt** under a **public feed** for that org key.

**Important:** Org cannot publish anything the sender did not co-sign, and the sender cannot publish under the org’s profile without the org’s co-sign.

---

## Editing & withdrawal

- **Edit:** Sender re-submits a new encrypted payload for the same `submission_id`, with a fresh `sender_sig`. Server preserves history with hashes; org UI shows diffs.
- **Withdraw:** Sender signs a `withdraw` control message; server flags submission `withdrawn`.
  - If an excerpt was already public, **withdrawal hides it** immediately (you can optionally require both parties to agree for re-publication).

---

## Abuse & safety without accounts

- **Rate limiting** per IP + per org key; sliding window.
- **Lightweight proof-of-work** (hashcash-style) or an accessibility-friendly challenge for bursts (avoid dark-pattern CAPTCHAs).
- **Attachment scanning** client-side (file type + size) + server-side content-type sanity checks.
- **PII guardrails** (local): regex detectors (NHS numbers, NI numbers, card numbers) prompt users with “Are you sure?” and encourage private channels for sensitive details.
- **Org-side moderation:** org can archive or ignore; can’t silently fake public praise because public items require sender co-sign.

---

## Privacy & data handling defaults

- **Data minimisation:** plaintext lives only **client-side** (org and sender). Server holds encrypted blobs + signatures.
- **Retention:** org chooses retention window, included in schema. Default 12 months; users can always request deletion (withdrawal).
- **No trackers.** No third-party scripts. Logs trimmed aggressively.

---

## API sketch (simple & boring)

- `POST /orgs` → returns `org_pub`, nothing stored except an **optional** signed name record if org wants a handle.
- `POST /schema` (body: signed schema) → store/update by `schema_id`.
- `POST /submit` (body: encrypted blob + sender\_pub + sender\_sig + schema\_id) → returns `submission_id`.
- `POST /edit/:submission_id` (body: new encrypted blob + sender\_sig).
- `POST /withdraw/:submission_id` (body: sender\_sig).
- `POST /publish-request/:submission_id` (org\_sig over proposed `public_excerpt`).
- `POST /publish-consent/:submission_id` (sender\_sig over the same `public_excerpt`).
- `GET  /public/:org_pub` → list of **co-signed public excerpts**.

All endpoints treat payloads as opaque; authorization is **by signature**.

---

## Frontend architecture (all-client-first)

- **React + Tailwind**.
- **WebCrypto** for keygen, sealing, signing; store keys in `localStorage` or IndexedDB with optional passphrase lock.
- **Worker** for crypto so UI stays snappy, especially when chunking attachments.
- **No SSR needed** at MVP; static app + thin API is fine.

---

## Edge cases & resolutions

- **Lost org key:** display loudly that **key = ownership**. Provide a **“key rotation”** mechanism: org publishes a signed rotation record (signed by both old and new keys) so clients trust the new key going forward. (If truly lost, they must create a new org and optionally link via a *community verification* post on their site/DNS.)
- **Sender on new device:** they can’t edit; that’s a feature, not a bug. They can create a **new submission** referencing the old `submission_id` if they exported their key; otherwise, it’s frozen.
- **Legal requests:** because server stores **only ciphertext**, compliance means notifying the org/sender; we can’t decrypt.

---

## Example: simple schema + flows

**Event: “Farm Open Day”**

- Fields: `rating (1–5)`, `what did you enjoy?`, `anything we should fix?`, `age group`, `mobility needs met? (yes/no)`.
- After event, org requests permission to publish only: `what you enjoyed` + `age group`.
- Sender co-signs → it appears on `actualfeedback.uk/#/o/<ORG_FP>/public`.

**GP practice:**

- Fields: `visit type`, `wait time`, `was it resolved?`, `anything you wish we knew (private by default)`.
- Practice publishes **aggregates only** (charts) — no need for dual signatures there, because aggregates contain **no individual text**. The practice UI can **prove** aggregates come from a set of signed submissions by releasing **hash commitments** (advanced, optional later).

---

## Why this works for your goals

- Sidesteps the “reviews as reputational warfare” trap.
- Puts **agency** and **safety** first (co-sign publishing, PII nudges, private-by-default).
- Scales from **temporary events** to **permanent services** with the same primitives.
- Slots neatly into BBB’s stack and values (no ads, no surveillance, civic utility).

---

If you want, I can turn this into:

- the **actual UI wireframes** (org setup, schema editor, inbox, publish-consent screen), and
- a **reference TypeScript module** (`keys.ts`, `crypto.ts`, `submit.ts`) showing keygen, sealing, signing, and dual-consent verification.

Say the word and I’ll draft those screens and code stubs end-to-end.


#### You:
you missed the point on encryption control. Think about it. You don't need a confirmation mechanism. Your org publishes a set of keys that the feedbacker uses when writing their packet (which is determined from a checkbox, but doesn't set a boolean flag). If they want it to be possible to have feedback published publicly, it's encrypted in such a way that makes it clear that the org publishing a follow on confirmation as a child of the feedback makes it possible for any user to decrypt it. It's a _little_ like a blockchain, as discussed in our original chats for various Actual... products. Cryptography technique defines what can happen.

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:
You’re right — the **crypto itself** should *define* what’s possible. No “ask for consent later”; the sender’s choice at submit-time shapes the packet so the org can (or cannot) publish later by emitting a child record. Here’s a tightened design that matches that:

# ActualFeedback — crypto-as-policy (no confirmations)

## Key roles (org-published “keyset”)

Org publishes a signed keyset (rotatable), each with a purpose:

- **K\_intake.pub** — for private inbox (only org can read).
- **K\_reveal.priv/pub** — a *gate* the org can later use to unlock a pre-authorised public capsule.
- **K\_log.pub** — for signing hash-linked children (append-only feed / Merkle-ish).

> “Signup” = generate these keys and publish the *public* parts (and a signed alias). “Login” = import private parts. No accounts.

## Packet anatomy (two-box pattern; no flags)

When a sender submits, the client builds **only** what the sender’s choices permit. There’s no boolean in metadata—capability is implied by presence/absence of parts.

- **A) Private payload (always)**
  - Symmetric key `Kpvt` → encrypt plaintext (private fields & attachments).
  - Encrypt `Kpvt` to **K\_intake.pub**.
  - Sign with sender’s key (so provenance is verifiable).

- **B) *Optional* Publicable capsule (only if sender ticks “allow potential public sharing of *these* fields”)**
  - Sender selects what can be publishable (specific fields or a redacted excerpt).
  - Symmetric key `Kpub` → encrypt that *publishable excerpt*.
  - **Encapsulate `Kpub` under K\_reveal.pub** (a KEM “capsule”).
  - Sign this excerpt (bytes) with sender key.
  - Include capsule + signed ciphertext in the parent packet.

> If the sender doesn’t choose B, there is nothing the org can later reveal—no capsule exists to open.

## Publishing = org emits a child

Later, to publish, the org **doesn’t ask anyone**. It simply appends a **child** of that submission to its public, hash-linked feed:

- Child includes:
  - Reference to parent (hash).
  - **Release material**: decapsulated `Kpub` (or a re-wrapped public broadcast key for anyone), plus an org signature with **K\_log.priv**.
  - Optional org reply metadata.
- Anyone can now verify:
  1. The child is signed by the org (K\_log).
  2. The released key unlocks the *exact* sender-signed publicable ciphertext from the parent.
  3. The resulting plaintext matches the sender’s signature.
- Result: public readers can decrypt **only** the pre-authorised excerpt—never the private payload.

> This is the “directionality by design”: the **sender pre-authorises** a specific publicable excerpt; the **org alone** decides if/when to reveal by publishing a child. No round-trips, no mutable flags.

## Hash-linked feed (lightweight, blockchain-adjacent)

- Every org has an append-only feed: `ORG_ROOT → child_1 → child_2 → ...` (each child references parent hash + previous child hash).
- Periodically publish a **checkpoint hash** (e.g., to DNS TXT or an external anchor) for tamper-evidence.
- Deletion from public view is possible (you control your feed), but *watchers* can mirror, and the cryptographic chain proves what existed.

## UI/UX (what users actually see)

**Sender form**

- Choose fields; checkbox: “Allow publishing of *selected* fields later.”
- If checked, a small picker shows which fields are part of the publishable excerpt.
- Client constructs A (+B if chosen). No accounts; a local key enables editing/withdrawal of *the submission*, but not needed for publish rights (those were baked into B).

**Org inbox (client-side decrypt)**

- Always sees A after decrypting with K\_intake.
- If B exists, a “Publishable” badge appears; clicking “Publish” auto-emits a child that reveals `Kpub` (or re-wraps it for public).
- Public page renders the decrypted excerpt, with proof: “Signed by sender key X, revealed by org at time T.”

## Crypto sketch (concrete but simple)

- Curves: X25519 (KEM) + Ed25519 (signatures).
- A) Private: `Kpvt = random(); C_pvt = AEAD_Encrypt(Kpvt, private_json); E_pvt = KEM_Encap(K_intake.pub, Kpvt)`
- B) Publicable (optional): `Kpub = random(); C_pub = AEAD_Encrypt(Kpub, publicable_json); E_pub = KEM_Encap(K_reveal.pub, Kpub); Sig_sender = Ed25519(private_sender, hash(C_pub))`
- Child publish: `Kpub = KEM_Decap(K_reveal.priv, E_pub); Child = {parent_hash, reveal: Kpub, sig_org = Ed25519(K_log.priv, hash(parent_hash || Kpub || C_pub))}`

*(Swap “reveal: Kpub” for a broadcast re-wrap if you prefer not to leak raw keys; either way, anyone gets the material to open `C_pub`.)*

## Schema & redaction model

- Org ships a **signed schema** that also marks which fields are *eligible* for publicable selection.
- Sender chooses which eligible fields to include in B; others live only in A.
- No flags in server metadata—verifiers rely on cryptographic structure.

## Edits & withdrawal (don’t break proofs)

- **Edit private**: sender re-encrypts A with a new `Kpvt` → new parent version (new hash).
- **Edit publicable**: creates a *new* publicable capsule (new C\_pub/E\_pub); old one still exists but unrevealed unless the org publishes it.
- **Withdraw**: sender can append a **withdrawal child** (signed by sender) that instructs polite UIs to hide; cryptographically, histories remain verifiable.

## Rotation & recovery

- **Org rotation**: publish a child “rotation” linking old and new keysets (both sign it). New packets use new keys; old packets remain decryptable with old key.
- **Sender loss**: they just can’t edit—by design. (Feedback still valid; private by default; publicable only if B exists.)

## Abuse, privacy, and safety

- No third-party trackers; encrypted-at-rest blobs.
- Client-side PII lints before a field moves into B (“This looks like NHS/NI/CC details—keep this private?”).
- Rate-limits + light proof-of-work to curb spam without CAPTCHA hell.
- Attachments chunked and encrypted per-payload (A and B separate).

---

### Why this nails your intent

- **No post-hoc consent dance.** The submit-time crypto *is* the policy.
- **Directional control:** Only the org can reveal, but only if the sender built B.
- **Verifiable authenticity:** Sender-signed publicable content prevents org tampering.
- **No secret flags:** Capability emerges from structure, not metadata.

If you want, I’ll draft:

- the **wireframes** showing A/B composition, and
- a **TypeScript reference** (`keyset.ts`, `packet.ts`, `publish.ts`) implementing the KEM/AEAD paths exactly as above.


#### You:
some feedback on the technicals for consideration

#### ChatGPT:
Right — with your clarification and the feedback doc in mind【36†source】, here are the key technical takeaways to consider for **ActualFeedback**:

---

## 🔑 Encryption / Keying Model

- **No proof-of-work needed**: As you said, this isn’t a resource-scarce system (unlike a cryptocurrency), so PoW just burns cycles. Rate-limiting and org-side filters are enough.
- **Keys as capability**: The design correctly uses the *structure of encryption/signing* (what capsules exist, how they’re wrapped) to define what is possible. That means there’s no mutable “publish flag” — either the sender pre-authorised a publishable capsule or not.
- **Org keysets**: Splitting into `K_intake`, `K_reveal`, `K_log` keeps roles clean:
  - Intake = read private channel.
  - Reveal = open the pre-authorised public capsule.
  - Log = append verifiable entries to the org’s feed.\
    These can be rotated independently, which is useful if one key leaks.

---

## 📦 Packet & Feed Structure

- **Parent packet** (always has A = private payload, optional B = publishable capsule).
- **Child packets** (reveals, withdrawals, responses) chained with hashes + signed with org’s log key. This makes the org’s behaviour auditable without needing a global blockchain.
- **Open mode**: For “reviews,” allow a C = plaintext, sender-signed payload. Org can append it directly to feed. Multiple reviews from the same sender key are linkable, which creates continuity without requiring identity.

---

## 🛡 Privacy & Abuse

- **Private by default**: Org is the only reader of A. Nothing leaks server-side.
- **Ephemeral editing**: Users can update/withdraw while they still have their key. Losing it freezes the state — which is acceptable under your “ephemeral by design” principle.
- **Spam handling**: Stick to simple measures (rate limiting per IP/key, lightweight throttles). No need for PoW. You can add optional friction later (e.g. only when spam is detected).
- **Moderation**: Since nothing is public unless the org appends it, abuse mostly manifests as noisy inboxes, which the org can filter/ignore. For open reviews, org’s log signature ensures only genuine, intentionally public submissions appear.

---

## ⚖️ Usability vs Crypto Safety

- **Sender key UX**: biggest sticking point. Keys are ephemeral and local, but if you want repeat editability/linkage, you’ll need to make key export/import dead simple (e.g. downloadable `.key` file, QR backup, or OS keystore).
- **PII safety**: client-side linting helps, but don’t over-promise; make “public mode” very explicit (“This will be visible to everyone — don’t include personal details unless you want them public”).
- **Verification by third parties**: If you want “public trust,” you’ll need lightweight libraries so anyone can verify signatures and feed integrity without trusting your server. That’s very doable (like how Certificate Transparency or Keybase sigchains are verified).

---

## 🚦Integration with other Actual tools

- **Trust optionality**: Unlike ActualNews/Jobs (where keys accrue or lose trust), here you can keep it trust-agnostic. But you could allow orgs to *opt-in* to showing trust scores from the wider BBB ecosystem (e.g. “this key is a high-trust contributor on ActualNews”).
- **Data portability**: Because everything is just signed JSON blobs, they can slot into **ContingencyNote** or feed into aggregated stats in **ActualNews**.
- **Cross-tool feeds**: The same hash-linked log design could underpin *Events* and *Neighbours* too — a shared infrastructure layer with different “packet types.”

---

✅ **Bottom line**:\
Your design is cryptographically sound, doesn’t require proof-of-work, and the “crypto defines capability” idea is elegant — it makes consent non-mutable and avoids dark-pattern toggles. The main risks are *usability* (helping non-technical users not lose keys or leak PII) and *moderation overhead* for open content. Those are solvable with UI nudges, local key backup helpers, and clear “public vs private” flows.

---

Would you like me to **draft a set of lightweight UI flows for ActualFeedback (both private feedback and open review modes)**, so you can see how this feels from a user’s perspective? That might make the trade-offs between private and open modes more tangible.


#### You:
A 'convenience' element of common use, aside from org-provided schemas, to pre-define input fields, might be to allow automatic aggregation, with some simple functions/parameters. So collecting star ratings from individual feedbackers can be simply averaged and displayed under the org by the properties they set. Or if collecting say a count of something, stock units in a corpo stock update system can just be totalled, even by class or type, again, definable at the schema stage.

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:
Love that—and it fits the “crypto-defines-policy” model cleanly. Here’s a practical way to add **built-in aggregation** to ActualFeedback without breaking privacy or adding server trust.

# Schema-level aggregation (simple, shippable)

Add optional aggregation directives to fields in the org’s schema. Think of them as **recipes** for rollups the org UI can compute and (optionally) publish.

### Field types that aggregate well

- `rating` (1–5) → `avg`, `count`, `histogram`
- `number` / `integer` → `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, `percentiles`
- `boolean` → `pct_true`, `count_true`, `count`
- `select` / `multiselect` → `count_by_option`, `pct_by_option`
- `datetime` (paired with a numeric field) → time-bucketed versions of the above (`per_day`, `per_week`)

### Simple schema extension

```json
{
  "id": "wait_time",
  "type": "number",
  "label": "Wait time (minutes)",
  "aggregation": [
    {"fn": "avg", "publish": "aggregate-only"},
    {"fn": "percentiles", "params": {"p": [50,90,95]}, "publish": "aggregate-only"},
    {"fn": "histogram", "params": {"bins": [0,5,10,20,30,60]}, "publish": "aggregate-only"}
  ]
}
```

- `publish` modes:
  - `"private"` – compute locally for the org dashboard only.
  - `"aggregate-only"` – org can **publish** the aggregate (no individual records).
  - `"publicable-excerpt"` – individual values may be included in the sender’s **B** capsule if they opted in (so either per-item or aggregate can be shown later).\
    This keeps capability in the **structure**, not a mutable flag—aligned with your crypto-as-policy approach. fileciteturn1file0

---

# How aggregates get published (two tiers)

## Tier 1 — **Straightforward, shippable now**

- The org’s dashboard computes aggregates **client-side** from decrypted submissions.
- To publish, the org emits a **child “aggregate” record** on their hash-linked feed:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "aggregate",
    "schema_id": "…",
    "field_id": "wait_time",
    "window": {"from":"2025-09-01","to":"2025-09-30"},
    "fn": "avg",
    "result": 14.7,
    "n": 213,
    "included": "hashes-only",    // or "omitted"
    "sig_org": "…"
  }
  ```
- Optional: include the **submission\_id hashes** (or parent packet hashes) used—so third parties can at least see the set referenced, even if they can’t decrypt individuals. This is easy to ship and good enough for most cases (star ratings, stock totals, etc.).

## Tier 2 — **Verifiable aggregates without revealing individuals** (optional, later)

If you want public **mathematical assurance** that the aggregates match the underlying (still-private) data:

- Have each sender attach a **commitment** to their numeric value at submit-time (in the parent packet), e.g. a Pedersen commitment `C_i` to `v_i`.
  - Commitments are additively homomorphic: the org can publish `C_sum = Σ C_i` and an opening `(v_sum, r_sum)` proving the **sum** is correct without exposing any individual.
- From sums + counts you get a verifiable **average**. For **grouped totals** (e.g., by product type), add one commitment per class label.
- Keep this **optional** and behind a schema switch like `"proofs": "commitments"`—so MVP stays simple, but you have a path to auditable stats later.

---

# Examples

### ⭐ Star ratings (classic)

Schema:

```json
{"id":"rating","type":"rating","aggregation":[
  {"fn":"avg","publish":"aggregate-only"},
  {"fn":"count","publish":"aggregate-only"},
  {"fn":"histogram","params":{"bins":[1,2,3,4,5]},"publish":"aggregate-only"}
]}
```

- UI shows: “Average 4.3 ★ (n=682) • distribution chart”
- If you enable commitments later, you can publicly prove the average/count without exposing any single rating.

### 🏭 Stock updates (internal ops)

Schema:

```json
{"id":"units","type":"integer","label":"Units in stock","aggregation":[
  {"fn":"sum","publish":"private"}
]}
{"id":"class","type":"select","options":["A","B","C"],"aggregation":[
  {"fn":"count_by_option","publish":"aggregate-only"}
]}
```

- Org dashboard totals by class in real time.
- They can publish a **child aggregate** (“Total units by class this week”) without leaking any item-level data.

### 🕒 Time-bucketed service metrics (e.g., GP waits)

- Pair `wait_time:number` with `visit_time:datetime`.
- Aggregations: `avg per day`, `p90 per week`, `histogram per month`.
- Publishing uses rolling windows (e.g., last 28 days), as **org-signed aggregate** children.

---

# Guardrails & UX

- **PII safety:** mark fields as **ineligible** for public aggregates (e.g., free-text). Aggregations should only apply to numeric/rating/boolean/select fields.
- **Clear labelling:** “Aggregate-only — no individual responses are ever exposed.”
- **Windows & filters:** schema can predefine filters (`location=store_17`) and windows (daily/weekly) so results are consistent and automatic.
- **Determinism:** fix bin edges and percentile method in schema to avoid “chart massaging.”
- **Rotation-proof:** aggregate children include schema version + field id, so later schema edits don’t retroactively change meanings.

---

# Why this fits BBB

- **Zero extra trust in servers:** all private decryption remains client-side; public aggregates are org-signed, and can be commitment-proved later.
- **Crypto sets the rules:** aggregate-only vs publicable-excerpt is **decided at submission by structure**, not a toggle that can be flipped later. fileciteturn1file0
- **Useful out of the box:** star ratings, counts, sums, histograms, time buckets—90% of what orgs need—without ever turning into a “review site.”

If you want, I can sketch the exact JSON schema for all supported aggregations (with defaults and validation), plus the shape of the **aggregate child** objects and a minimal verification script.


#### You:
This possible-aggregation does give us a problem of handling large amounts of children. Assuming we have/need a server to handle the 'chain' storage/tree, we can't publish the entire thing to every client (well, we could, but that would be stupid). For public data we can marshall that, but the more compute we have to do, the more costly it becomes for the server. We probably want to think about monetisation at some point. Org-pays would make most sense in most situations, and they would be paying for their key (i.e. no account needed, the payment processor just tells us what was paid for and what 'key' paid for it). There might still be more need for backend custom use-cases, which we'd have to wrap around the cryptographic stack, rather than embed within it (time gating say, maybe image hosting or file uploads, where the packet references the amazon-s3 id (privately of course)).

#### ChatGPT:
Totally agree—once you let orgs append-and-append, the “nice cryptography” meets the “oh no, we have millions of children” problem. Here’s a design that keeps your crypto-as-policy intact while making storage, sync, and costs sane—and sets up an org-pays model without introducing accounts.

# Scalable log + cheap queries (without breaking the crypto)

## 1) Split the feed into **headers + bodies** (and shard it)

- **Child header** (tiny, public): `{ child_id, parent_hash, prev_child_hash, type, ts, sizes, content_hashes, org_sig }`
  - \~150–300 bytes each; enough to verify chain integrity and plan fetches.
- **Child body** (chunky): the actual payload (e.g., aggregate JSON, open review text, reveal material).
- **Shards**: rotate feeds by **time** (e.g., monthly) or **size** (\~50k children). Each shard is its own mini-chain with a **shard-root hash**. Publish shard roots in a compact “manifest” per org.

**Why:** Clients can sync just headers (fast) and selectively fetch bodies. Servers can keep hot shard manifests in memory and cold-store old bodies cheaply.

## 2) Give clients a light sync protocol

- `GET /org/<org_pub>/manifest` → list of shard roots + ranges.
- `GET /org/<org_pub>/shard/<id>/headers?cursor=…&limit=…` → header page.
- `GET /org/<org_pub>/child/<child_id>/body` → fetch body when needed.
- **Filters on headers:** `type in {aggregate, open_review, reveal}`, `time range`, `field_id`, `schema_id`.
- **Integrity:** Clients verify shard-root signature, then the header chain, then per-child signatures. Bodies are pulled only for the children they care about.

**Result:** You’re not “publishing the entire thing to every client”—you’re streaming tiny summaries and pulling fat blobs lazily.

## 3) Aggregates at scale: incremental + cached

- **Windowed children:** Make aggregates explicit by window: daily/weekly/monthly nodes (e.g., `type="aggregate", window="2025-09-01..2025-09-30"`).
- **Incremental recompute:** When a new submission lands, only the current window’s aggregate needs updating; publish a new aggregate child that **supersedes** the prior one (link via `supersedes_child_id`).
- **Cheap percentiles:** use **t-digest** or **HDR histogram** in the child body. No per-request recompute.
- **Server-side cache (optional):** cache the latest aggregate body per window; evict when a newer one supersedes it. Still verifiable because the child is signed.
- **Verifiable sums/averages (later):** Pedersen commitments if you want math-provable rollups without revealing individuals—toggled in schema. (Not needed for MVP; revisit when you care about third-party auditors.) fileciteturn1file0

## 4) Query indexes without trust creep

- Build **secondary indexes** on the server **over headers only** (time, type, field ids). No plaintext needed.
- For public/open text, index the open bodies in a separate search service (costly but optional).
- For private submissions, never index bodies—org decrypts client-side and can build their own local index.

## 5) Attachments & big files (cheap and private)

- Use **client-side encryption** per-payload key.
- Upload via **S3 presigned PUT**; store `{ bucket, key, sha256, length }` in the packet (encrypted when private).
- Public excerpts can reference separate public objects/CDN (still hashed), or reveal a symmetric key + object hash in the child.
- This keeps your server out of the hot path (bandwidth billed to the org’s S3).

## 6) Time-gating & “backend wrappers” without polluting crypto

- Keep cryptography the **capability** layer; use backend wrappers for **availability**:
  - **Time-gated publishing**: org appends a signed child with `not_before`/`expires_at`; the server honors it for API visibility. (Public mirrors may ignore it; that’s fine—treat as availability, not authority.)
  - **Rate limits, quotas, webhooks**: metered at the API layer keyed by `org_pub`.
  - **Custom transports** (email/SMS receipts, Slack hooks): off-chain notifications; on-chain you still have the signed children.

# Monetisation without accounts (key = customer)

## 7) Billing & metering keyed to `org_pub`

- **Checkout flow:** payment processor session includes `metadata: { org_pub }`. On webhook success:
  - Create/update an **entitlement record**: `{ org_pub, plan, limits, renewal, status, signature }`.
  - No username/password; “login” is still importing the org key.
- **Quotas by plan** (example):
  - Storage (encrypted bodies) GB
  - API writes (submissions/day) and **public children**/day
  - API reads (headers/bodies/day)
  - Attachment relay bandwidth (if you proxy) or none if org uses own S3
  - **Compute units** for server-side aggregate generation or search (if you offer it)
- **Graceful enforcement:** when over quota, private intake still accepted (or soft-limited), but **public endpoints throttle** (e.g., slower header pages, reduced body fetch). Show a signed “quota-warning” child so mirrors have a canonical note.
- **Add-ons:** extra storage, dedicated search index, higher aggregation cadence, custom retention.

## 8) Pricing that matches cost drivers

- **Free (dev/test):** small caps, single shard, no public search index.
- **Starter (most SMBs):** moderate storage, public feed, daily aggregates, basic search.
- **Pro (councils/large orgs):** higher retention, hourly aggregates, attachment proxy, analytics API.
- **BYO S3 discount:** if they store their own attachments, your bandwidth cost drops.

# Ops & durability

## 9) Cold storage + mirroring

- **Hot shards** on fast storage; **cold shards** on cheap object storage (S3/Glacier). Restore on demand.
- Encourage **public mirrors** to replicate shard headers + public bodies (like “read-only relays”) for resilience; mirrors verify signatures, not trust you.
- **Anchors:** periodically anchor each shard root hash into DNS TXT or a public notary (cheap, keeps tamper-evidence).

## 10) API hygiene for “lots of children”

- Cursor pagination, never offsets.
- **Field masks** to avoid over-fetching (headers vs bodies vs specific child types).
- **Conditional GET** with `If-None-Match` on shard manifests/headers.
- **Backpressure**: 429 with `Retry-After`, adaptive rate limits per key & IP.

# Why this balances cost + principles

- **Crypto stays the source of truth.** Capability = packet structure. Publishing = signed children. We never add “flags.”
- \*\*Servers do **routing, indexing, and pagination**, not decryption or global trust. That’s cheap and safe.
- **Cost scales predictably** with storage, bandwidth, and specific compute (aggregates/search), which orgs can pay for **by key**—no accounts needed.
- **Custom backends** (time-gates, images) wrap around, not inside, the crypto layer.

If you want, I can turn this into:

- a minimal **OpenAPI** for the manifest/headers/bodies/billing endpoints,
- a **shard rotation** and **supersede** logic spec,
- and a tiny **client sync reference** (TypeScript) that pages headers, verifies the chain, and lazily pulls bodies.

Also happy to sketch pricing bands aligned to realistic infra costs once you ballpark expected volumes.


#### You:
On ActualJobs our keys can manage sub-keys (both for orgs and individuals), we should do that here too. A paid parent org key can have many sub orgs (say a University paying for all their research fellows to use it as a research collecting tool, but with no authority over the parent or peer keys, only the parent key can invalidate (with our server) the signing keys). Not sure we'd have a use case for it on the feedbacker end, but maybe a parent could pre-approve a response from their child, or someone in a guardian role/etc.

#### ChatGPT:
Love it. Let’s add **hierarchical keys & scoped delegation** to ActualFeedback in a way that’s consistent with your “crypto = policy” model, avoids accounts, and fits billing.

Below is a compact spec you can drop into the design.

# Hierarchical keys (org + optional sender)

## Roles

- **Parent org keyset (root)**: `K_root = {K_intake, K_reveal, K_log}` already defined.
- **Sub-org keys (delegates)**: minted by the parent via **delegation certificates**. No server trust required to *recognise* a delegate; the server is only used to *rate-limit/bill* against the parent.

> We keep the *capabilities* in signed certs; the server never grants powers—clients and verifiers do, by checking signatures and scopes. (Matches your earlier crypto-as-policy approach. fileciteturn1file0)

---

## Delegation certificates (DCs)

A **DC** is a signed object from the parent that *binds* a child public key to specific powers and constraints.

```json
{
  "type": "delegation",
  "parent_org_pub": "base58",
  "child_pub": "base58",             // the delegate’s master pub (or trio; see below)
  "scopes": [
    // choose from the capability set below
    {"cap": "intake_decrypt", "schema_ids": ["*"], "expires": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"},
    {"cap": "publish_reveal", "schema_ids": ["survey-2025"], "fields": ["rating","wait_time"], "expires": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"},
    {"cap": "append_log", "types": ["aggregate","open_review","note"], "expires": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"}
  ],
  "limits": {"writes_per_day": 2000, "public_children_per_day": 200, "attachments": true},
  "metadata": {"label": "Chem Dept – Fellows"},
  "issued_at": "2025-09-10T19:45:00Z",
  "sig_parent": "ed25519:…"
}
```

### Capability set (scopes)

- `intake_decrypt` — decrypt private A-packets addressed to the **delegated intake key** (see key splitting below).
- `publish_reveal` — emit **child reveal** nodes for publishable capsules **B** (only for fields explicitly allowed by schema **and** included by the sender).
- `append_log` — append any non-reveal children (e.g., aggregates, open reviews, notes, withdrawals acknowledged).
- `rotate_keys` — (rare) permission to publish a rotation child for a specific sub-org subtree.
- `schema_manage` — publish/update signed schemas under the parent.

Each scope can be further limited by `schema_ids`, `field_ids`, `types`, and **expiry**.

> Scopes are verified client-side when rendering authority (e.g., a viewer checks that a reveal child is signed by a key whose DC covers `publish_reveal` for the relevant `schema_id/field_id`)—no central ACLs.

---

## Splitting delegate keysets safely

We don’t want sub-orgs to inherit *all* root secrets. Use **distinct subordinate key triplets**, issued by the parent:

- `K_intake_child` — its own X25519 pair, published in a **keyset update** child so senders can target it directly (e.g., routing submissions for a lab to that lab’s intake).
- `K_reveal_child` — its own reveal pair; parent grants `publish_reveal` to this child via DC.
- `K_log_child` — its own signing pair for appending children (aggregates, notes, reveals if allowed).

Parent publishes a **Keyset Declaration** child:

```json
{
  "type": "keyset_declare",
  "sub_org_id": "uuid-or-slug",
  "intake_pub": "base58",
  "reveal_pub": "base58",
  "log_pub": "base58",
  "dc_hash": "sha256(DC)",        // binds the declaration to the delegation certificate
  "sig_parent": "…"
}
```

**Routing:** An org can provide multiple endpoints (root + sub-orgs). The sender form can choose the target (e.g., “Chemistry Dept”)—the app then encrypts A/B to the **sub-org** pubs. This gives **true separation**: the lab can read what’s sent to it; the parent **cannot** decrypt those A-packets unless the design intentionally also encrypts to parent (don’t, unless needed).

> If the parent wants oversight, you can support **multi-recipient A-encryption** (encrypt `Kpvt` to both the child’s intake and the parent’s intake). Make this a schema toggle; default to **single recipient** for genuine delegation.

---

## Revocation & suspension

- **Revocation child** (by parent):
  ```json
  {
    "type": "delegation_revoke",
    "dc_hash": "…",
    "reason": "key compromised",
    "ts": "…",
    "sig_parent": "…"
  }
  ```
  Viewers and servers must treat any post-revocation actions by that child as unauthorised.

- **Suspension window** (temporary): same shape but with `not_before`/`not_after` to pause a delegate.

- **Rotation**: publish a `keyset_rotate` child for a sub-org (signed by parent) with new pubkeys and a reference to the previous declaration.

---

## Billing with parent key, no accounts

- Payments map to `parent_org_pub`.
- **Metering** accrues on the parent for *all* children under its tree (root + delegates), enforce plan limits at the API layer using the DC’s `limits`.
- Server only needs the **DC hash** to attribute usage; no PII. If a University pays, all Fellows (sub-orgs) operate under that budget, but **crypto prevents the parent from impersonating or retroactively altering a child’s signed children**.

---

## Server API notes (minimal changes)

- Accept children signed by **either** `K_log_parent` or any declared `K_log_child` **with a valid DC**.
- Expose **manifests per org** that include sub-org keyset declarations and DC hashes so clients can verify chains.
- Enforce quotas at ingress using `(parent_org_pub, dc_hash)` pairs.

---

## Sender-side delegation (optional / guardian flows)

You might *not* need it for feedbackers, but here’s a safe pattern when you do:

- **Cosign requirement at submit time** (crypto-policy): The schema can require `cosigners: ["guardian_pub"]`. The sender app then:
  1. Builds A and optional B as usual.
  2. Signs with **sender**.
  3. Also obtains a signature from **guardian\_pub** over the packet hash (either on the same device, or via QR handoff / deep link).
- The packet is only accepted if **both** signatures exist; verifiers can check that the guardian signature matches a **guardian DC** published by the parent (or org) that scoped the guardian to `cosign_submit`.

This avoids any “post-hoc approval” flows; the requirement is **baked into the packet**.

---

## How this plays with aggregates, reveals, and open text

- **Aggregates**: Sub-orgs can publish their own aggregate children (signed by `K_log_child`). If you want roll-up aggregates at the parent level, do it by **referencing** child aggregates (include child hashes) rather than re-computing from raw private bodies the parent can’t read.
- **Reveals**: A sender’s B-capsule targeted to a **sub-org’s K\_reveal\_child** can only be opened by that sub-org. If you want the parent to be able to reveal as well, the sender would include a **second** capsule addressed to the parent’s `K_reveal_parent`. Capability is structural; there’s no flag.
- **Open reviews**: Sub-orgs can append open text to their own shard(s). Parent can optionally mirror/quote child items by appending “reference” children that point to the sub-org child hashes.

---

## Example end-to-end (University → Fellows)

1. **Parent** generates DC for “Fellows cohort A” with scopes: `intake_decrypt`, `append_log`, `publish_reveal` (schema: `study-XYZ` only), expiry in 6 months.
2. Parent publishes **keyset\_declare** for each Fellow (or a shared lab account) with their three pubs + `dc_hash`.
3. **Fellow** runs the org dashboard with their **child** private keys; they receive and decrypt private feedback, publish study aggregates, and (if allowed) reveal authorised public capsules.
4. **Parent** pays the bill; server attributes usage to `parent_org_pub` based on `dc_hash` lineage.
5. **Revocation**: if a Fellow leaves, parent publishes `delegation_revoke(dc_hash)`; from that point, any new child signed by the old `K_log_child` is considered invalid by clients and rejected by API.

---

## Security & UX guardrails

- **Non-transitivity by default**: Children **cannot** delegate unless the parent includes a scope like `may_delegate: true` (and even then, limit scopes and expiry aggressively).
- **Least-privilege templates**: “Intake-only”, “Analytics-only”, “Publish-only”, “Full lab admin” presets for DCs.
- **UI clarity**: In the org dashboard, every action shows **which key** is acting and **which DC** authorises it; clicking reveals scope, expiry, and revocation status.
- **Sender routing**: Make the target (parent vs sub-org) explicit in the form header (“You’re sending feedback to: *Chemistry Dept (Fellows)*”).
- **Backups**: One-click export of child keysets as passphrase-encrypted bundles; parent stores DCs safely (DC loss doesn’t break verification if already published, but you’ll want them for audits).

---

## Why this matches your goals

- **Crypto-enforced boundaries**: Parent can fund, rotate, revoke—but cannot read or forge child content unless the *sender structure* permits it.
- **No accounts**: All authority lives in signed DCs + published keyset declarations; “login” is importing keys.
- **Scalable ops**: Billing, quotas, sharding, manifests work the same; you just accept children from multiple authorised log keys under one parent umbrella.
- **Extensible**: The same pattern ports to ActualJobs/News/Dating for team/org hierarchies.

If you want, I can sketch the exact DC JSON schema (with validation), the `keyset_declare/rotate/revoke` child shapes, and the client-side verification routine that enforces scopes on reveal/append.


#### You:
Aside from "because you can't farm your user data" and "losing a key could be bad, if you had critical information" (which most don't), why don't orgs do this already?

#### ChatGPT:
There are a few pretty pragmatic reasons why you don’t see most organisations today offering “bring your own keypair” with on-chain delegation as the entire identity and billing model, even if the arguments you’ve been sketching are compelling:

---

**1. Business model and incentives.**

- A lot of SaaS vendors *do* monetise by knowing who their users are. Even if they don’t directly sell data, having account profiles feeds into marketing, upsells, and investor stories. A design that deliberately prevents the service operator from linking behaviour to real people cuts against that grain.
- Billing by email address or SSO identity is also what finance teams are set up to handle. Billing by “public key entitlements” is unfamiliar to their sales and accounting departments.

**2. Support and compliance.**

- In most commercial settings, customers expect to be able to call support and say “I’m locked out, please reset me.” If the only credential is a private key, and it’s lost, then—by design—nobody, not even the vendor, can help. Many enterprises don’t want to carry that risk.
- Regulatory regimes (KYC/AML in finance, HIPAA in health, etc.) sometimes *require* the provider to be able to link activity to a legal person. That constrains how much anonymity or pseudonymity they can tolerate.

**3. Usability and key management.**

- Ordinary users are not good at safeguarding cryptographic keys. Losing a signing key would mean losing the ability to prove control of the account; leaking it means irrevocably delegating your identity. Services that serve a broad, non-crypto audience tend to avoid pushing this complexity onto users.

**4. Ecosystem expectations.**

- There isn’t yet a broadly adopted, interoperable standard for self-sovereign key management in SaaS. While DID/VC and other decentralised identity frameworks exist, they’re still emerging. Many organisations don’t want to be early adopters of infrastructure that might not have mature libraries, audit tools, or clear legal footing.

**5. Operational leverage.**

- Having centralised accounts gives the service leverage to enforce terms of service, implement abuse controls, and integrate with other business systems (e.g. CRM, access control). Moving all that into client-side key management plus verifiable credentials means a bigger shift in their product and support model.

---

So it’s not that cryptographic delegation is infeasible—it’s that it comes with **trade-offs** in supportability, regulatory obligations, and revenue models. A project like yours can deliberately choose to live further along the “self-sovereignty / minimal trust” spectrum, but large incumbents often prioritise control and customer-relationship features over those properties.

---

✅ **Suggestion:** If your vision is to normalise key-based delegation, it helps to:

- Provide simple, user-friendly tooling for generating, backing up, and revoking keys.
- Wrap delegation in UX that looks familiar (“invite teammate”, “link guardian”) so orgs don’t feel like they’re teaching crypto.
- Make billing attribution by parent key as seamless as possible (e.g. via payment provider metadata).\
  That reduces the practical friction that usually keeps mainstream services from adopting this model.

Would you like me to sketch some **concrete onboarding flows** for parent orgs creating sub-keys and handling lost keys, so you can see how to communicate this to non-crypto-native users?


#### You:
you'd think the normalisation of e2ee would make this more popular, but I suppose Facebook/meta aren't really using e2ee to protect their users, but to protect themselves, legally speaking, from the consequences of their users' private chats. Like to avoid being a publisher.

#### ChatGPT:
You’re right to notice there are a couple of different motivations that often get conflated when people talk about end-to-end encryption (E2EE):

- **User-centric privacy and safety.** A service can choose to implement E2EE because it wants to give its users the strongest possible assurance that nobody — not even the provider — can read their private communications. That’s the “crypto as empowerment” angle you’ve been exploring.

- **Provider liability / regulatory posture.** For large platforms that operate in many jurisdictions, being able to say “we literally cannot read the contents” also has legal and reputational advantages. It allows them to deflect pressure to monitor or censor private conversations, and reduces their exposure to liability for what users say to each other. It doesn’t mean the provider isn’t monetising metadata or other behavioural signals — as you noted, there’s still a business incentive to gather information, and E2EE doesn’t protect against all forms of data collection.

So the motivations can differ. One operator may market E2EE as a user right; another may embrace it partly to limit its own obligations. Both things can be true simultaneously.

---

**Why isn’t key-based delegation more common yet?**

- **Market readiness:** Most mainstream users are not used to managing cryptographic material themselves. Lost keys mean irrevocably lost access, which is a customer-support nightmare. Providers who need low friction often stick with passwords/SSO and centralised recovery flows.
- **Business models:** As you said, centralised identity and data collection are valuable for advertising and growth. Delegating control to user-held keys reduces a platform’s leverage and its data-collection ability.
- **Standards & tooling:** Unlike TLS or basic transport encryption (which has become standard), the patterns for self-sovereign key delegation are not yet widely commoditised. There’s no equivalent of “Let’s Encrypt” for user identity keys at mass-market scale.
- **Regulatory complexity:** Some industries are legally obliged to retain or disclose user data on request. If a provider cannot access encrypted content, it risks regulatory conflict. That tends to slow adoption.
- **Migration costs:** Retrofitting a running service with a whole new identity and billing model is a big engineering and product lift; incumbents may not see enough upside to offset that cost.

---

✅ **Key insight for you:** Normalisation of E2EE for messaging doesn’t automatically mean normalisation of *self-sovereign key-based account models*. The former is about transport/content secrecy; the latter touches governance, billing, and business incentives. If you want to push adoption of your delegation model in something like “ActualReviews,” showing how it *improves admin workflows* (e.g. letting universities delegate without giving up control) and *doesn’t* remove the provider’s ability to bill or enforce quotas is critical to overcoming the inertia.

Would you like me to put together a **contrast table** showing how a “BYO key + delegation” model differs from the status quo across axes like *privacy*, *support*, *compliance*, and *business control*? That might help you articulate why an org would—or would not—embrace this.


#### You:
okay, so selling the sizzle, we _could_ make the entire point of "No accounts, just secure your key" the USP of the entire Actual... product range. If law enforcement want to read someone's stuff (hypothetically), they need their physical key, like a padlock. They can't (thus don't need to) come to us, we just don't have it, never did.


#### ChatGPT:
Exactly — that *is* the big differentiator, and it’s worth surfacing as a deliberate **value proposition** rather than a side-effect:

- **“We can’t read your stuff.”** If everything of substance (A packets, private fields, sensitive attachments) is encrypted to the holder’s keypair before it leaves their device, then the service is functionally a dumb relay + indexer. That means you, as the operator, are not in a position to be pressured to hand over user content — you never had it in the clear.

- **No centralised accounts.** Instead of username/passwords that you can reset or surveil, the *keys are the account*. That’s a mental shift for mainstream users, but as you noted, it can be turned into a simple, strong narrative: “Your key *is* your account; you don’t have to trust us with your data, just don’t lose your key.” This can become the **USP across the whole suite** (Jobs, Reviews, News, etc.).

- **Legal positioning.** Messaging companies like WhatsApp/Signal talk about E2EE partly because it allows them to say, truthfully, “we cannot read your messages.” That changes their relationship to law enforcement and regulators. Extending that to structured data, feedback logs, survey results, etc. sets you apart from incumbents that retain a central cleartext copy.

- **Operational boundary.** The backend can still offer value — routing, bandwidth, indexing of *public* data, providing entitlements keyed to an org’s root key — without becoming a custodian of secrets. You stay in the business of running infrastructure, not being a honeypot of user content.

- **Education/UX challenge.** The flip side: if you make “your key is your account” the centerpiece, you’ll need to invest in *very good user-facing explanations and recovery patterns*. People are now used to Apple/Google/Meta’s E2EE messaging and might accept “we can’t read your stuff,” but they still expect “I forgot my password, send me a reset link.” That doesn’t exist if you don’t hold keys. You’d want to pair the USP with a clear *safety net* story (delegated guardian keys, social recovery, optional backups).

---

🔮 **Strategic framing:**

- Position yourself not as “we’re different because we don’t have accounts,” but as “we give organisations and individuals *real* control over their data, with provable cryptographic guarantees.”
- Frame the law-enforcement angle carefully: rather than “we don’t care,” emphasise *we’ve deliberately engineered ourselves so that we’re not in the loop* — we can comply with lawful orders on the metadata/hosting side, but cannot be compelled to hand over plaintext we never possessed.

---

Would you like me to draft a **user-facing messaging narrative** (the “sizzle” copy you could put on a landing page) that explains this “your key is your account” concept in accessible language?


#### You:
there is NO "reset my password", and because of the way we use this for 'portable' contexts, there is no locksmith. It's very very clear... Do NOT lose your key. 

#### ChatGPT:
Got it — you want to lean *into* the “there is no password reset” reality, rather than apologising for it. That can actually be a strength if you present it clearly: it makes the trust model obvious and keeps the platform out of the loop. Here are some ways you might frame that as a **feature, not a bug**:

---

## 🔑 “Your Key *is* Your Account”

- **You hold the keys.** There’s no username, no email/password on our servers. What proves your identity is the cryptographic key that lives with you.
- **We can’t unlock your data.** If someone asks us for your private messages or survey answers, there is nothing we can hand over — they’re encrypted for you and your organisation only.
- **No reset button.** Unlike a consumer social app, there is no “Forgot Password?” link. This isn’t a flaw — it’s what makes your key as strong as a physical lock. If you keep your key safe, nobody else can impersonate you. If you lose it, nobody (not even us) can recreate it. Just like losing the key to a safe, the contents are protected *by the absence of a back door*.
- **Simple story for teams.** When a university or company buys an organisation key, it can mint sub-keys for individual researchers or departments. Those sub-keys work like office keys: you can hand them out, revoke them, or rotate them. But the “master key” never leaves the organisation’s control.

---

## 🚀 Why this is compelling

- **True self-sovereignty.** Data stays yours; control stays with whoever holds the key.
- **Clear accountability.** Only the delegate that signed a packet can be seen to have sent it. No hidden overrides by the service.
- **Reduced liability.** The platform can host and serve, but cannot spy; regulators and investigators must go to the key holder, not the infrastructure provider.
- **Portability.** If a researcher moves from one university to another, they carry their key. Their past submissions remain provably theirs, without needing to re-register accounts.

---

💡 **UX note:** because “no reset” is counter-intuitive for many people, it’s worth pairing this message with simple recovery strategies — e.g. optional encrypted backups, social/guardian cosigning, or institutional key escrow if the org wants it. You can still keep the USP (“we cannot unlock your data”) while giving users a clear path to avoid accidental loss.

---

Would you like me to sketch some **concrete user-facing wording** — e.g. the kind of copy you could drop straight into the marketing site to make this point clear to a non-technical audience — in a short, compelling style?


#### You:
About 5 years ago I did a version of this that issued you two images that encoded (via a partial matte QR code, applied to an image of your choice (or one from our gallery), which was cropped to a square), one with both your private and public keys, and one with only your public key, with some text on each image that clearly stated what each was for. This _kinda_ worked, but I think it was just more confusing than giving out a .key file anyway. It might be worth considering an option, mainly because on mobile phones, images downloaded are often auto-uploaded to google photos or apple cloud or whatever else, which has _some_ benefit, but does risk leaking keys, or say accidentally posting to social media. It does however make for 'shared permissions' contexts, where the user DOES want to share their key 'visually', this makes it possible say to put up stickers in your town letting everyone publish to a 'shared' but secretly open 'account'. If that makes sense. It's a double-edged sword but could have use-cases that take the internet or digital file out of the system and into the real world.

#### ChatGPT:
You’re pointing at something really interesting: the difference between *using cryptographic keys as an account primitive* versus *how you package and move those keys around*.

What you tried five years ago — encoding the key material as a QR overlaid on an image — is actually a neat “tangible” metaphor. A few observations about that approach:

---

### 🔐 Two QR images (private + public)

- **Pros**
  - *Portability*: JPEGs/PNGs are natively handled on every phone, and they tend to get backed up automatically to iCloud, Google Photos, etc. — which can act as a kind of “free” off-site backup.
  - *Shareability*: handing someone a printout or sticker with the “public” QR is easy. For things like “community inbox” or “feedback wall” you can literally paste it up in physical space.
  - *UX clarity*: labeling one “KEEP SAFE — this is your key to post” and the other “Share this — others use it to send you things” is a strong, memorable metaphor.

- **Cons**
  - *Accidental exposure*: people are used to throwing images into group chats, posting them on social media, or having them scanned into cloud photo libraries. A private-key-in-a-JPEG can leak invisibly.
  - *No partial revocation*: if someone copies the private QR from your sticker, they can post as you indefinitely unless you’ve got the delegation/revocation machinery we discussed.
  - *Hard to rotate/backup well*: an image in a gallery is easy to duplicate but also easy to lose or leak. Without a companion backup mechanism (seed phrase, passphrase, or secure cloud vault), the risk of accidental lockout is high.

---

### 🧩 How to incorporate the idea safely

- **Offer it as one “export format.”** Let a user who already has a keypair in their app choose “Create shareable public QR” or “Download my private key as QR” with big red warnings. That way you keep BYOK as the primary model, but you enable the playful/physical distribution scenarios.
- **Encourage best practices.** For private-key images, force the user to set an app-level passphrase before exporting, and bake into the image a bold overlay like *“PRIVATE — do not share”*.
- **Support visual import.** Make sure the client can scan/parse both your custom QR-with-background and a plain base58/hex QR. That way a person can restore their key from a printed backup if their phone dies.
- **Enable *public* “stickers” via DCs.** If a parent org wants to put up a poster so anyone can submit feedback, generate a sub-org `K_intake_child` and produce a “public QR” that encodes only its intake pub. It can be printed on posters, T-shirts, etc. That makes the *visual portability* feature a nice, optional layer on top of the core key model.
- **Make the model obvious in copy.** e.g. *“This image IS your key. Anyone who has it can act as you. Keep your private key image secret. Print or share your public key image to let people send you messages.”*

---

### 🌉 Bridge to mainstream comfort

A recurring theme: if you’re offering “no accounts, just keys” as the USP, you’ll need to **reduce the cognitive overhead** for everyday users:

- Provide a *simple recovery option* that’s consistent with the promise. E.g. encrypt the private key with a user-supplied passphrase and let them stash the QR in their cloud; optionally let them appoint a few guardians who can cosign a recovery if they lose the phone.
- Use *visual metaphors* (stickers, badges, “your private key is like your front-door key”) to make the consequences tangible.
- Let institutions pre-mint and distribute branded “public key posters” that invite feedback, while keeping control of private keys in safe hands.

---

✅ In other words: what you did with dual QR images was ahead of its time. As you say, it’s a double-edged sword — great for portability and offline/physical distribution, but dangerous if people confuse “public” vs “private.” If you want to fold this into the “No accounts, only keys” story for **Actual…**, consider keeping QR export as an *advanced* or *optional* path, and couple it with the delegation/revocation machinery so that lost/stolen “stickers” don’t become a permanent problem.

---

Would you like me to sketch a **user-facing flow** for how an organisation would generate a “public sticker” sub-key and later revoke it if it got abused? That could be a concrete feature description for your product docs.


#### You:
I suppose there are cryptographic options that give you a key (.key file or encoded visually), but ALSO require a password to 'use' the key to do anything, kinda giving us 'username password login' but without a server as authority, using the key instead. The 'password' is still secret in their head, and will only unlock with the password. They lose resettability (I think) and still cannot 'forgot password' (maybe some signing proxy _could_ hypothetically do this, but kinda breaks the encrytpion)

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:
Yep—there’s a clean way to get the *feel* of “username + password” **without** introducing a server authority: you encrypt the private key *locally* with a passphrase and only ever use it after decrypting in-memory. No reset, no central oracle—just better day-to-day safety.

Here’s the practical shape:

# What you want

- **A .key (or QR) that’s useless without a passphrase.**
- **Unlock happens only on the user’s device.** The server never sees the passphrase or the raw private key.
- **Same guarantees as before:** if they lose the passphrase, you *still* can’t help (by design). This preserves your “no locksmith” model.

# How to implement (rock-solid + shippable)

1. **Generate a strong random keypair once.**\
   Don’t derive keys from the password (human passwords are weak). Always generate high-entropy keys and **wrap** them with password-based encryption (PBE).

2. **Protect the private key with a KDF + AEAD:**
   - KDF: **Argon2id** (or scrypt) with high memory/time (tunable), a random 16–32B **salt**, and store the parameters next to the ciphertext.
   - AEAD: **XChaCha20-Poly1305** (or AES-GCM) to encrypt the private key bytes using the KDF output.
   - Result is a **“lockbox”**: `salt, kdf_params, nonce, ciphertext, aead_tag`.

3. **Store/Export formats (both work):**
   - **`.key` file** (binary or JSON) containing the lockbox + the public key + metadata (alg, created\_at, hints).
   - **QR** (or “image QR”) that encodes the **encrypted** lockbox (never the raw key).
     > If someone posts the QR by mistake, it’s still useless without the passphrase.

4. **Unlock flow = local only:**
   - User enters passphrase → KDF derives a wrapping key → AEAD decrypts the lockbox → private key lives in RAM/secure enclave for the session → sign/decapsulate → wipe from RAM.

5. **Mobile hardening (recommended defaults):**
   - On iOS/Android, store the encrypted lockbox in the **OS keystore** and gate *access to the lockbox* behind **biometric + passcode**. (Biometrics don’t replace the passphrase; they’re an extra gate to the encrypted blob.)
   - Offer “Quick Unlock” sessions with biometric, but require the **passphrase** for sensitive actions (publishing children, rotating keys, exporting).

6. **Rate-limit and hinting (local):**
   - Throttle passphrase attempts locally (exponential backoff).
   - Let users add a short, non-secret “hint” string stored in the header.

# File/QR payload example (human-auditable)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "alg": {"sig":"ed25519","kem":"x25519","aead":"xchacha20poly1305","kdf":"argon2id"},
  "pub": "base58…",                        // public key / fingerprint
  "lockbox": {
    "salt": "b64…",
    "kdf": {"m": 67108864, "t": 3, "p": 1},// 64MB, 3 iters, 1 lane (tune per device)
    "nonce": "b64…",
    "ct": "b64…"                           // AEAD(ciphertext of private key)
  },
  "created_at": "2025-09-10T20:45:00Z",
  "label": "My Actual key",
  "hint": "Our wedding city + year"
}
```

QRs carry the same JSON (or a compact CBOR/BECH32 variant). “Private QR” is just this payload; “Public QR” is the public key/fingerprint alone.

# What you *don’t* want

- **Password-derived keypairs (deterministic keys).** Tempting, but unsafe: password entropy is too low, and you can’t safely rotate or strengthen later.
- **Server-side “unlock proxies.”** Any service that can sign for you (even with PAKE/MPC magic) becomes a de facto account authority. It punches a hole in your “we can’t act on your behalf” guarantee.
- **Auto-uploading raw private keys.** If you support “image keys,” ensure those images carry **only encrypted lockboxes** and are loudly watermarked (“PRIVATE — passphrase required”).

# “Forgot password?”—what’s the *BBB* answer

You’ve said it plainly: **there isn’t one.** But you can **offer optional, user-controlled safety nets** that don’t create a backdoor:

- **Encrypted backups:** one-click export of the **encrypted** `.key` (same lockbox) to iCloud/Drive. Still useless without the passphrase.
- **Social/guardian recovery (optional):**
  - Give users a **2-of-3 recovery kit**: Shamir split of a *passphrase* (or of a second wrap key) held by trusted people; combine to rewrap the private key if truly lost.
  - Or, **guardian co-sign** model: users pre-register guardians who can **co-sign a delegation** from a new key to replace the old (orgs honor this because it’s baked into your crypto policy—no server discretion).
- **Institutional escrow (org-only, explicit):** allow *orgs* (not individuals) to store an extra wrap key in their own HSM, disclosed in UI. End users keep full control elsewhere.

# Why this hits your goals

- **Feels like “username + password”** (you type something to unlock), **without** creating an account system or recovery hotline.
- Preserves your **law-enforcement stance**: you never hold the plaintext key or passphrase.
- Plays nicely with your **hierarchical/delegation** model: parent can require “passphrase unlock” for high-risk actions, but cannot reset a child’s passphrase (no locksmith).
- Lets you keep the **physical world** angle: stickers/QRs work, but safely—because they contain **encrypted** material only.

If you want, I can draft:

- a tiny **keyfile/QR spec** (CBOR + BECH32 for compactness),
- **Argon2id parameter tables** (desktop vs mobile defaults), and
- the **unlock UI copy** (“There is no reset. Protect this passphrase like a real key.”) so this ships cleanly.


#### You:
just logging additional grok feedback (see the end parts you haven't ingested yet)

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly — the fact that you’re designing around **no reset / no locksmith** is the radical bit. It’s what makes the *“your key is your account”* message so different from what Meta/Google are doing with E2EE. A few reasons why incumbents don’t build things this way, beyond the “we want to mine your data” and “we want to avoid liability” points you already noted:

---

### 1. **Support burden vs. business incentives**

- Most commercial SaaS lives or dies on reducing churn. “I lost my password” is the number-one support ticket. If you make it impossible to reset, a non-technical customer base will just churn and complain.
- Providers prefer account systems they can reset, because it keeps customers locked in *and* makes them feel like there’s a safety net — even if that means holding the master keys.

### 2. **Regulatory/contractual pressure**

- In finance, healthcare, even education, regulators and insurers often *require* that operators can recover or disclose data. If you design a system that says “we never can,” you’re implicitly saying “and we can’t help if you lose it.”
- Big companies don’t like that posture, because it puts them at odds with law-enforcement or compliance obligations. Offering E2EE “so we can’t be blamed as publisher” is a safe stance, but offering *non-recoverable* keys would get them in trouble when regulators expect data retention or lawful access.

### 3. **Monetisation & identity linkage**

- Centralised accounts (email, phone number, OAuth) are the hook for upselling, advertising, cross-app profiling. BYO keys break that loop: no identifiers, no behavioural dossier, no lock-in.
- So from a pure revenue model standpoint, it runs counter to their incentives.

### 4. **Usability + mental models**

- A `.key` file or QR code that, if lost, is gone forever? For a general-consumer product, that’s terrifying. Mainstream users expect to call a helpdesk and recover.
- Even with a passphrase wrapper, you still need to explain “if you lose both the file and the passphrase, everything is gone.” That’s a trade-off most incumbents don’t want to foist on their customers.

### 5. **E2EE ≠ self-sovereign identity**

- WhatsApp/Signal popularised the idea of “nobody can read your messages.” But identity is still provider-controlled (your account is tied to your phone number, and WhatsApp can ban you).
- Your design goes further: the *crypto primitives enforce control and directionality*. That’s much closer to the “self-sovereign identity” world (DID, SSI), which hasn’t yet crossed into mainstream SaaS because it’s unfamiliar and doesn’t mesh with centralised business models.

---

🔑 **So the gap you can fill with Actual…**\
You’re not selling *ease of recovery* or *marketing data*, you’re selling:

- **No backdoors.** If law enforcement want access, they go to the keyholder, not you.
- **No lock-in.** The key is portable, like a physical key.
- **No surveillance rent.** Because you literally don’t have the data, you can’t monetise it — and you don’t want to.
- **New use-cases.** Physical key/QR sharing, ephemeral contexts (events, neighbourhoods) that big platforms aren’t incentivised to build.

---

👉 Next step: do you want me to draft the **landing page USP narrative** for this “no accounts, just your key” philosophy across the whole Actual… suite, so you can test whether it resonates with normal people? That would be a way of “selling the sizzle” without dropping into crypto jargon.


#### You:
DID? SSI? gimme a glossary in this space

#### ChatGPT:
Got it 👍 — here’s a **glossary of the main acronyms/terms** you’ll bump into when talking about “keys not accounts,” self-sovereignty, and decentralised identity. I’ll keep it in plain English but precise enough you can navigate the standards space.

---

# 🔑 Glossary — Key-based Identity & Self-Sovereignty

### **DID — Decentralized Identifier**

A W3C standard for identifiers (think “usernames”) that aren’t controlled by a central registry (like ICANN for domains).

- Example format: `did:example:123456789abcdefghi`
- Each DID resolves (via a “DID document”) to public keys and service endpoints.
- Different “methods” exist (e.g. `did:web` = hosted on a website, `did:key` = just a key, `did:ethr` = anchored in Ethereum).

### **SSI — Self-Sovereign Identity**

A design philosophy: people/organisations control their own identifiers and credentials, not a central provider.

- Means you “own” your keypair and associated claims (like “I am over 18,” “I work at Org X”).
- No provider can delete or lock your account, only you can lose your keys.

### **VC — Verifiable Credential**

A digital version of a credential (like a passport or membership card) that:

- Is issued by someone (signed by their key),
- Is held by you,
- Can be selectively presented (you prove you have it, without showing everything).\
  Often encoded in JSON-LD + JWT or JSON-LD + linked data proofs.

### **Holder / Issuer / Verifier (the SSI triangle)**

- **Issuer**: entity that signs a credential (e.g. a university signs “Alice graduated”).
- **Holder**: you, the person/organisation who stores that credential.
- **Verifier**: someone you present it to (e.g. an employer verifying your degree).

### **VC Wallet**

An app or agent that stores your credentials (VCs) and DIDs. Analogous to a physical wallet with ID cards.

### **DID Document**

The JSON blob you get when you resolve a DID. Contains:

- The public keys,
- How to authenticate (e.g. signatures, key agreement),
- Service endpoints (like “here’s my inbox URL”).

### **Trust Framework**

A policy layer on top of the tech: defines which issuers/verifiers are recognised in a specific ecosystem.

- Example: “UK universities trust this root list of credential schemas.”

### **ZKP — Zero-Knowledge Proof**

A cryptographic method to prove something without revealing the underlying data.

- E.g. prove “I’m over 18” without showing your exact birthdate.
- Used in advanced VC presentations.

### **Selective Disclosure**

The ability to show *some* fields of a credential, not all. E.g. from a driver’s license credential, just reveal “21+” and not your home address.

### **Credential Schema**

Defines the structure of a credential: what fields, what types.

- E.g. “Vaccination credential has fields: vaccine\_type, date, issuer.”

### **Revocation Registry**

A public log an issuer can update to mark a credential as no longer valid (like revoking a certificate).

- Often implemented as a hash list or blockchain entry.

### **Agent / Mediator**

In SSI lingo, an **agent** is software that acts on behalf of you (the keyholder) — can be a mobile app, server, or cloud service.

- **Mediators** forward encrypted messages between agents (like post offices).

### **DIDComm**

A messaging protocol built on DIDs for secure, private communication between agents.

- Think: encrypted email but tied to DIDs/keys.

### **DID Resolution**

The process of taking a DID (like `did:web:example.com`) and getting its DID document.

- Methods differ — some use blockchains, some use DNS/HTTPS, some are key-only.

### **Interop Profiles (like Aries / Hyperledger Indy)**

Practical implementations of SSI that try to ensure different wallets/agents can talk to each other.

- **Indy**: early ledger for identity.
- **Aries**: protocols for wallets/agents.
- **AnonCreds**: early credential format with ZKP support.

### **W3C VC Data Model**

The formal spec (from W3C) that defines how VCs look and behave.

- JSON-LD heavy, but other encodings (JWT) are also common.

---

## 🧭 How this relates to your “Actual…” tools

- You’re **not** trying to build a full SSI stack (no global trust frameworks, no universal wallets).
- But the same principles apply: keys are the identity, crypto defines what’s possible, and there’s no central reset authority.
- The DID/VC world gives you *terminology* and some *interop options* if you ever want your keys/feedback credentials to be recognised outside your ecosystem.

---

Would you like me to map which of these SSI/DID pieces are **worth borrowing for Actual…** (and which are overkill), so you don’t end up accidentally re-implementing the heavy parts of SSI you don’t need?


#### You:
okay great. Can we use a DID-standard-linked identifier/model/approach for our keys?

Our SSI design philosophy seems to fit already. I would like to be able to support age-gating, especially with the UK's recent age verification requirements for businesses over 3m users (and other tiers), so we _could_ verify a key is 18 or over via a third-party. A meta bundle associated with the key would include a signed property provided to the stack by the verifier, is how I imagine it, but maybe there are existing solutions. Legally it would be great to say this has been verified to be a real person with some properties like a 'safe' age, without having to actually handle doing that ourselves, so we can stay non-carrying of data (I can't remember what GDPR calls that, but I want zero GDPR responsibilities too). If anything, a 'portable' signed packet that proves a user has verified their identity or age 'somewhere' can solve a lot of our problems by keeping the auth inside the cryptographic design.

Are VC wallets on device common? Do password managers typically handle this? Or can we integrate with ones who do, easily? I'm fine with the user trusting their key to a secure third party (as long as it has a vault/etc) who we know can be trusted, as long as we don't have to hold any part of that ourselves.

Revocation is more complicated. Per node is fine, some of our Actual... systems (like ActualNews which can be federated) have trust systems linked to publishers, and commenters/pundits can be escalated or banned, tho that's within the trust system, not within the content system.

#### ChatGPT:
Yes — what you’ve described maps **very closely** onto DID/VC practice, and you can borrow the useful pieces without dragging in the whole SSI bureaucracy. Let me break it down in your context:

---

## 🔑 Using DIDs for Actual… keys

- Your existing model (org key, sender key, delegation) is already “DID-like”: *an identifier = a public key + a document that describes its capabilities*.
- You could publish each org/user key as a **DID** (e.g. `did:key:z6M…` for a bare Ed25519 key, or `did:web:actualfeedback.uk:org:pubfp` for something anchored at your infra).
- That DID resolves to a **DID Document** containing:
  - the public keys (`K_intake`, `K_log`, etc.),
  - service endpoints (e.g. “send me feedback here”),
  - optional metadata (like delegation chains).

This gives you **interop for free**: anything that understands W3C DIDs can already parse your keys and their proofs.

---

## 🎓 Age-gating via Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

- Instead of you verifying age/identity, you rely on a third-party **issuer** (Yoti, Post Office EasyID, GOV.UK Verify, or future Ofcom-approved providers).
- They issue the user a **Verifiable Credential**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential","AgeCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:web:yoti.com",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:key:z6Mkw…",  // your Actual… key
      "over18": true
    },
    "proof": { "type":"Ed25519Signature2018", "created":"…", "jws":"…" }
  }
  ```
- The user stores this in their wallet (device).
- When they need to prove they’re over 18 to ActualNews/ActualDating, they attach the signed VC.
- **You don’t hold any personal data.** You only verify:
  - the credential was signed by a trusted issuer’s DID,
  - it applies to the presenting key (`credentialSubject.id` matches their key),
  - it hasn’t expired / been revoked.
- That makes you a **verifier**, but not a **data controller** under GDPR — you’re not processing DOBs, names, etc. Just boolean flags like “over18: true.”

---

## 📱 Wallets on device

- Yes, VC wallets exist and are becoming more common.
  - **Apple Wallet** and **Google Wallet** are already trialling age/ID credentials (EU Digital ID, ISO mDL).
  - Specialist wallets exist too (Trinsic, Dock, Lissi, Bloom, Yoti, etc.).
- Password managers (1Password, Bitwarden) don’t natively support W3C VC flows, but some are moving that way.
- Easiest path: **integrate with existing wallets** via DIDComm/QR handoff. E.g. you show a QR, user scans with Yoti/ID wallet, wallet sends back a signed VC.
- You can also offer a **local “mini-wallet”** in your app (just encrypted JSON blobs, like you’re already designing for key storage). That keeps dependency minimal.

---

## ❌ Your responsibilities (GDPR etc.)

- Under GDPR you avoid becoming a **data controller** by not collecting PII.
- If you only see “over18: true” (cryptographically signed by someone else), that’s not personal data you control — it’s a fact about the credential.
- You do need to maintain a **trust framework**: a list of issuers you’ll accept (Ofcom-certified age checkers, GOV.UK, EU IDs). That’s policy, not data handling.

---

## 🔄 Revocation

- Each VC spec supports revocation via a **revocation registry** (e.g., a bitstring or Merkle tree published at a DID endpoint).
- So if Yoti decides a user’s “over18” credential is no longer valid, they flip a bit.
- You just re-check the issuer’s revocation list at verification time.
- You don’t need to store or propagate this yourself, just trust the issuer’s revocation endpoint.
- In your *trust system* (like ActualNews), you can separately maintain “trust scores” (ban keys, downrank them) — that’s orthogonal to VC validity.

---

## 🌉 How to integrate, practically

1. **Make every Actual… key a DID** (use `did:key` or `did:web`).
2. **Define schemas** for the VC types you care about (AgeCredential, RealPersonCredential, etc.).
3. **Maintain a trusted-issuer list** (Ofcom-certified age checkers, GOV.UK, maybe NHS for health status in some contexts).
4. **Verification flow:**
   - User proves control of their key (signs a challenge).
   - User presents a VC bound to that key (`credentialSubject.id = did:key:…`).
   - Your server/client verifies the issuer signature + revocation status.
   - You *never see DOB/Name/etc.* — only the boolean claim.

---

✅ This way:

- You get age-gating / “real person” proof **without ever holding PII**.
- You stay GDPR-light: you’re not a controller of identity data.
- You remain consistent with your “crypto defines policy” philosophy.
- Users can reuse the same VCs across all Actual… tools.

---

👉 Would you like me to sketch **one canonical “AgeCredential” VC schema** (fields, example, revocation link) in JSON-LD/VC Data Model style, so you can drop it into your stack as the standard you’ll accept?


#### You:
Think about the features set for ActualDebates or Debatr, that is like Twitter or Reddit but for structured discussion, like substack but two way, not just broadcast, but formal responses and observers with assessments are baked in. It's not about picking a winner, but establishing shared understanding of complex or nuanced issues.

Don't focus on implementation or crypto, just design features, minimum set. Assume good faith actors for now

#### ChatGPT:
Perfect — if **ActualDebates / Debatr** is meant to be *“Twitter/Reddit/Substack but structured, two-way, and aiming for shared understanding rather than point-scoring”*, then the feature set should be very different from likes/karma wars. Here’s a **minimum but powerful feature set** you could ship around that idea:

---

# 🗣️ ActualDebates (Debatr) — Feature Sketch

### 1. **Structured Debate Threads**

- **Topic = a “prompt”** (e.g. “Should the UK adopt a 4-day working week?”).
- Threads have *roles* instead of free-for-all comments:
  - **Pro position** (one or more posts arguing *for*).
  - **Con position** (one or more posts arguing *against*).
  - **Responses**: linked replies from either side, explicitly “response to” a specific point.
- **Nested arguments**: Each claim can spawn a structured counterclaim, rather than drifting off into tangents.

### 2. **Claims & Evidence Blocks**

- Posts are broken into **claims** (short, declarative statements).
- Each claim can have **supporting evidence** attached (links, citations, or attached data).
- Evidence has its own metadata (source, type, date, confidence level).
- Readers see a clear “claim → evidence” relationship instead of free text walls.

### 3. **Response Types**

- When replying, users pick the *mode*:
  - **Counter-argument** (challenge claim with reasoning or evidence).
  - **Clarification** (ask for definitions, scope).
  - **Expansion** (builds on existing claim, adds nuance).
- Keeps debate constructive by forcing intent to be explicit.

### 4. **Observer Layer (Assessment, not votes)**

- Instead of “likes”/“downvotes,” observers can:
  - Tag a claim with **agreement**, **disagreement**, or **needs evidence**.
  - Leave **summaries** (“This point is supported by X, but contested by Y”).
- Optional **consensus view**: aggregates these assessments into a visual map (e.g. claims in green = widely accepted; amber = mixed; red = contested).
- Readers get a *map of understanding* rather than a leaderboard.

### 5. **Positions & Profiles**

- Each participant’s contributions are grouped under their key (pseudonym or org identity).
- You can see all the claims someone has made across debates → helps establish their consistency and stance without needing to “follow” them like Twitter.
- Optional **organisation voices** (via parent org keys from your delegation model).

### 6. **Debate Lifecycle**

- **Propose a debate**: anyone can suggest a topic (signed by their key).
- **Open phase**: participants add structured arguments & counterarguments.
- **Observation phase**: observers assess, annotate, cluster agreements/disagreements.
- **Close/archive**: debate becomes a **frozen feed** with a *summary layer* (auto-generated + human-curated). This creates a lasting civic resource.

### 7. **Navigation & Discovery**

- **Argument maps**: visual graph view (claims, responses, support/attack).
- **Subtopics**: ability to “branch off” into more specific debates (like subreddits, but structured).
- **Cross-linking to ActualNews**: a news item can spawn a debate thread; ActualDebates provides the structured deliberation space.

### 8. **Tone & Safety Nudges**

- No “ratio,” no karma score. Instead:
  - Prompts for constructive phrasing (“Try stating your point as a claim”).
  - UI emphasises listening/understanding over winning.
  - Observer summaries surface common ground.

### 9. **Publishing / Portability**

- Every debate is an **append-only feed** (same cryptographic log idea).
- Excerpts/consensus summaries can be embedded in other Actual… tools (e.g. a policy brief on **ActualNews** can link to the underlying structured debate feed).
- Pseudonymous keys mean participants can be consistent across debates without doxxing.

---

## 🎯 Why this is different

- Moves beyond “votes = truth.”
- Makes intent explicit (pro, con, clarify, expand).
- Shifts focus from personalities to *claims and evidence*.
- Encourages observers to surface consensus, not just conflict.
- Leaves a durable, transparent record that can feed into policy work (perfect for BBB).

---

Would you like me to **lay out a concrete “user journey”** (what it feels like to start a debate, contribute, and see the consensus map emerge) — almost like a storyboard you could use in presentations?


#### You:
​This kinda leads us also to like ActualAnswers which is our Reddit or quora

#### ChatGPT:
Yes — that’s a natural next piece in the ecosystem. If **ActualDebates / Debatr** is about structured back-and-forth on *contested or nuanced questions*, then **ActualAnswers** would be the “ask/answer” layer — more like Quora, StackExchange, or the question-threads you see on Reddit, but without the reputation-gaming, engagement-hacks, or data-sucking.

Here’s a **minimum viable feature set** for **ActualAnswers** in the BBB style (crypto-based identity, no central accounts, civic-minded defaults):

---

# 🙋‍♀️ ActualAnswers — Structured Q\&A Without the Noise

### 1. **Question as a First-Class Object**

- A question is a **signed packet** (from a user or org key).
- It has a title + description + tags (topics, locations, etc.).
- Optional schema fields: e.g. “What’s the issue?” “What sources have you already checked?” (nudges toward better-formed questions).

### 2. **Answers as Linked Children**

- Anyone with a key can post an answer (signed child of the question).
- Answers can include structured claim/evidence blocks (like in Debatr), but less formal — closer to StackOverflow answers.
- Answers can be edited/withdrawn by the same key later (ephemeral model).

### 3. **Responses / Discussions**

- Answers can have *comment-type* children for clarifications or improvements (not flamewars).
- Explicit “Ask for clarification” vs “Add supporting info” modes, to avoid messy threads.

### 4. **Observer Layer (Instead of Karma)**

- No upvotes/downvotes.
- Readers can tag answers with:
  - **Clear / Unclear**
  - **Supported / Needs sources**
  - **Worked for me / Didn’t work** (for practical Qs)
- Aggregated visually (like a little matrix or confidence meter).
- Shifts focus from popularity contests to *usefulness signals*.

### 5. **Cross-Tool Integration**

- **From ActualNews**: every news item could have a “Questions” tab: “Ask the obvious questions this story raises.”
- **From ActualDebates**: spin off “side questions” that become their own Answer threads.
- **From ActualNeighbours**: local Q\&A (e.g. “Where can I borrow a ladder in SW9?”) using same infra, but with neighbourhood-bounded visibility.

### 6. **Discovery & Re-use**

- Questions are indexed and discoverable by tag, location, or link.
- Every question has a permanent public feed (`actualanswers.uk/#/q/<hash>`).
- Answers are verifiable (signed by key) and can be cited in **ActualNews** or **Debatr**.

### 7. **Civic Orientation**

- Questions don’t die — they *accumulate knowledge*.
- Summaries can be generated (auto + community-authored) to distill “current best answer” without hiding alternatives.
- Orgs can answer too (e.g. “Council answers your bin collection questions”) using their org keys — builds trust.

### 8. **Moderation / Safety**

- As with other Actual tools:
  - No public content unless the signer intended it (open-text mode).
  - Abuse handling is via org or community flagging → feeds include “flag” children.
  - Trust layer optional: reuse ActualNews/Jobs trust scores to highlight reliable contributors.

### 9. **Ownership & Portability**

- The same **key-as-identity** principle: no central accounts, just your key.
- Multiple answers from the same key are linkable, so people can see patterns and track record.
- Keys can carry optional **VCs** (e.g. “verified NHS professional,” “over 18”) without you holding PII.

---

## ✨ Why this matters for BBB

- Replaces Reddit/Quora’s ad-based, engagement-optimised model with a **civic Q\&A commons**.
- Makes it easy for people to ask local or national questions and get answers that are **structured, cited, and verifiable**, not just noisy opinions.
- Builds on the same **feed + key + optional VC** infrastructure as ActualFeedback, Debatr, etc.
- Provides government/policymakers with a real-time *map of what questions people have*, not just outrage trends.

👉 Do you want me to sketch how **ActualDebates** and **ActualAnswers** could *interlock*? (e.g. a question escalates into a debate, debates generate FAQs that flow back into answers, and both feed into ActualNews/ContingencyNote.) That would show how the suite hangs together into one civic stack.


#### You:
​Okay, across this entire chat we have lots of Actual... products, and need to identify the libraries we'd need to build, structured into sensible modules that help us build all these systems with minimal per project code, so we'd just take our server components, plug them in to each other (maybe as lambas with say postgres backend or disk storage, etc), add some styling, and boom, product.

#### ChatGPT:
awesome—let’s turn everything we’ve designed into a tidy, reusable **Actual Platform** you can drop into any “Actual…” app with minimal glue. Think: a TypeScript monorepo of small, composable packages + lambda-friendly server pieces + shared UI.

Below is a pragmatic module map. Each item is **small**, has a crisp responsibility, and ships with adapters (Postgres/S3/Dynamo/etc). You won’t need all of them in every app.

## TL;DR composition recipe

1. Pick **product thin app**.
2. Wire **@actual/api-gateway + ingress + publisher + storage + shard-index**.
3. Drop in **@actual/ui** blocks (keys, forms, feed, aggregates).
4. Toggle **@actual/vc-verify** if you need age/real-person gates.
5. Turn on **@actual/billing** if it’s paid; plug **@actual/payments**.
6. Ship.

If you want, I can turn this into a **repo scaffold** (folder structure + package.jsons + a tiny working Feedback app) so you can start from a running baseline and iterate product by product.


#### You:
Let's add ActualTickets to our product list. 

#### ChatGPT:
Nice — adding **ActualTickets** rounds out the suite really well. This one’s basically *“ethical Eventbrite/Ticketmaster”* but stripped of fees, dark patterns, and lock-in. It’s a natural fit with **ActualEvents**, but narrower: it’s about *entry, allocation, and access control* rather than community organising.

Here’s a **feature sketch for ActualTickets** (minimum set, civic-minded, portable, key-first model):

---

# 🎟️ ActualTickets — fair, transparent ticketing

### 1. **No accounts, just keys**

- Buyers generate a personal key (or reuse an Actual… key).
- Ticket = a signed + optionally encrypted **credential** bound to that key.
- “Your ticket is your key” — present by scanning QR, or by signing a challenge at the door.

---

### 2. **Ticket as a packet (credential)**

- **Issued by org key** (`K_log_org`) → signed JSON object:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "ticket",
    "event_id": "evt-123",
    "seat": "A14",
    "valid_on": "2025-10-03",
    "holder_pub": "did:key:z6M…",
    "sig_org": "ed25519:…"
  }
  ```
- Optional: **encrypted metadata** (name, accessibility needs, payment proof) sealed to the org’s intake key.
- Org can publish a public list of “ticket-issued” children for verifiability (so duplicates are detectable).

---

### 3. **Fair allocation (no scalping, no dark patterns)**

- **Schema-driven ticket rules:**
  - Max N per holder key.
  - Optional geo / age gate (using VC proofs).
  - Lottery-based allocation (signed draw child in org’s feed).
- **Transparent supply:** Org publishes **ticket-batch declaration** child (how many tickets, how priced, release time). Anyone can verify later no extra shadow tickets were minted.

---

### 4. **Transfer & resale**

- **Delegation model:** Holder can mint a **transfer child** that assigns the ticket to a new holder key.
- Org can configure:
  - *resale disabled*, or
  - *resale capped* (org defines max resale price in the ticket schema),
  - *resale allowed only to whitelisted VCs* (e.g. students, local residents).
- Transfer is enforced cryptographically: new holder\_pub is signed by old holder key *and* acknowledged by org’s log key → tamper-evident chain of ownership.

---

### 5. **Entry / scanning**

- At venue, ticket-holder shows QR with their key or signed challenge.
- Venue agent app verifies:
  - Org signature (ticket valid).
  - Holder signature matches `holder_pub`.
  - Ticket not revoked or superseded.
- Verification works offline if you’ve synced the org’s ticket feed manifest ahead of time.

---

### 6. **Observer / public view**

- Org can optionally publish **ticket metrics** (issued vs capacity, resale stats, % local residents).
- Feed is hash-linked and verifiable; prevents hidden over-issuance.
- Public trust: “This festival issued exactly 500 tickets; 472 are in circulation.”

---

### 7. **Monetisation fit**

- **Org pays per ticket batch** (number of tickets issued, not per buyer account).
- **No buyer fees.** A direct alternative to Ticketmaster-style rent-seeking.
- Value props: predictable cost for organisers, provable fairness, no gouging of attendees.
- Optional add-ons:
  - Payment processor integration (Stripe/GoCardless, etc.)
  - Reserved allocation rules (age-gated, resident-only via VC verify)
  - Analytics dashboard (via @actual/aggregate)

---

### 8. **Integration with other Actual… tools**

- **ActualEvents**: every beacon can link to a ticket schema → one-tap issuance flow.
- **ActualFeedback**: tickets automatically include a feedback link (attendee gets private form afterwards).
- **ActualNeighbours**: small local orgs can issue free community tickets via a printed “public QR” on posters.
- **ContingencyNote**: keep your tickets in your key vault; guardians can help recover if lost.

---

### 9. **Minimum viable feature set**

- Org key creation (BYO key).
- Ticket schema (event\_id, seat/general, valid date).
- Ticket issuance: org signs + publishes ticket children.
- Holder receives **ticket credential** bound to their key.
- Entry check = scan + signature verify.
- Optional: age/eligibility proof with VC attached.
- Billing = per ticket batch issued, keyed to `org_pub`.

---

👉 Do you want me to put **ActualTickets** into the modular library map we drew up (so it’s clear which existing pieces it reuses, which new modules it needs — e.g. a `@actual/ticketing` package with issuance, transfer, scanning)?


#### You:
Hard sell without venue ownership and scummy ticketmaster monopoly control. Would need to target indie venues and sell the sizzle to performers or organizers

#### ChatGPT:
Exactly — Ticketing is the trickiest of your “Actual…” ideas because it’s the most heavily gatekept by incumbents. You don’t get to walk in and replace Ticketmaster at the O2 Arena unless you own the O2. But there’s still a strong *strategic wedge* if you position **ActualTickets** as a **performer/organiser-first, indie-friendly alternative** rather than trying to fight the monopoly on its home turf.

---

## 🎟️ ActualTickets — Indie-first angle

### Who you’re really building for

- **Small venues** (pub back rooms, grassroots music spaces, community theatres) who resent 20–30% fees but lack the tools to DIY ticketing.
- **Independent artists & organisers** who don’t want to give up data or revenue just to run a gig, workshop, or community event.
- **Attendees** who are sick of “£15 ticket + £7.50 booking fee.”

---

### “Sizzle” to sell

- **No platform tax**: flat, predictable pricing (org pays per batch, not per buyer).
- **Your event, your crowd**: you own the key, you own the audience. We can’t mine it, sell it, or lock you out.
- **Cryptographic fairness**: public log of issued tickets = verifiable “no overselling, no bots hoarding.”
- **Grassroots friendly**: print a QR sticker → that *is* your box office. No account setup, no paperwork.
- **Seamless post-event feedback**: attendees already have a ticket key, so they can securely drop feedback to the organiser via ActualFeedback.
- **Portable trust**: a performer’s key can show reputation built in ActualDebates/News (e.g. “this activist has published 20 verified answers, here’s their track record”).

---

### Minimum viable organiser flow

1. **Generate an org key** (no account).
2. **Create event schema**: title, date/time, capacity, optional fields (e.g. ticket tiers, age restriction via VC claim).
3. **Issue tickets**: pay a flat fee for a block of N tickets → get a signed batch.
4. **Distribute tickets**:
   - Share a QR invite (for free events).
   - Or link a payment processor checkout → successful payment triggers issuance.
5. **Check in**: staff scan QR at the door → verify org signature + holder’s signature. Works offline if feed manifest is preloaded.
6. **After event**: automatically send an ActualFeedback link to ticket-holders’ keys.

---

### Growth strategy

- **Target indie venues & performers**: emphasise *zero booking fees* and *control over audience data*.
- **Make physical distribution easy**: posters, flyers, venue stickers with “scan to claim ticket.”
- **Leverage ActualEvents**: every event beacon can have a “claim ticket” button → seamless path from discovery to ticket.
- **Position as civic infrastructure**: “This isn’t about scalping; it’s about fairness and community. We’ll never price-gouge your fans.”

---

### Integration with BBB stack

- Uses the **@actual/delegation** module → venues can mint sub-org keys for different promoters or nights.
- Uses **@actual/packets** for ticket issuance + transfer + revocation.
- Uses **@actual/vc-verify** for age-gating (e.g. “over 18 only”).
- Uses **@actual/feed-log** for public issuance proof (no hidden extra tickets).
- Uses **@actual/attachments** only if tickets carry rich media (optional).
- Uses **@actual/aggregate** to publish sold/remaining numbers transparently.
- Hooks directly into **ActualEvents** for discovery, **ActualFeedback** for post-event feedback, and **ActualNeighbours** for local promotion.

---

### Key message for organisers

> *“Stop giving away 30% of your ticket revenue to platforms that don’t care about your fans. With ActualTickets, your keys are your box office. You issue tickets directly, decide how they’re distributed, and if you want to cap resale prices, that’s enforced cryptographically. No accounts, no hidden fees, no lock-in — just fair, transparent ticketing that puts you and your audience first.”*

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch a **tiered monetisation model for indie venues** (e.g. free up to 100 tickets/month, then flat £/block) that fits this positioning, so you can see how it avoids Ticketmaster’s rent-seeking while still covering infra?


#### You:
Considering our entire Actual... tech stack, can you write a high-level pitch, that focuses on the USP and the user/market-value rather than on the technical details. Essentially I want an explainer for the high-school senior reading ease level that explains why accounts are bad (personal privacy, toxic tracking/profiling/etc), why federation is bad (single points of failure, one hack means everything is vulnerable), how cryptography as user key solves these problems, along with a focus on systems design than prioritise low-risk/low-cost units, built-in disposability, and a system of trust that you only use when you need it (including how it doesn't use 'cryptocurrency' costly/problematic issues). Essentially it's how do we sell e2eDe where the D stands for Data, so we get a framework for system design that is not vulnerable by design, because even the platform operator can't exploit it (the root problem).

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s the story we’re selling, in plain English.

# Actual — keys, not accounts

**One line:** Actual builds everyday apps (news, jobs, feedback, tickets, debates, Q\&A) that work without accounts, ads, or tracking. You hold a *key*, not an account. Your key is your identity. Your data stays with you.

---

## Why “accounts” are the root problem

- **Accounts leak power.** Email + password puts the platform in charge. They can read, reset, ban, sell, and profile. If they get hacked, *you* get hurt.
- **Tracking is built-in.** Accounts stitch your actions together across products and devices. That’s great for ad-tech; terrible for privacy.
- **Resets = backdoors.** “Forgot password?” means someone else can be you. That’s a feature for support, and a gift for attackers.

## Why federation isn’t the rescue you think

- **Same account model, different landlord.** You still trust a server admin with the keys to your world.
- **Many single points of failure.** Each server is a jackpot for attackers. One phish. One misconfig. One breach.
- **Still incentive-driven.** Federated hosts drift toward the same growth and data incentives as the big platforms.

---

## The Actual way: e2eDe (end-to-end *Data* encryption)

- **Your key, your rules.** You create a cryptographic key on your device. There’s no username. No email. No account to reset.
- **We can’t read your stuff.** Data is encrypted *before* it leaves your phone or laptop and can only be opened by the people you choose. Even we, the platform, can’t see it.
- **Crypto = policy.** What can be shared (or published later) is decided at the moment you send it, by how it’s encrypted. Not by toggles we could flip later.
- **No cryptocurrency.** No tokens, no mining, no “burning a lump of coal.” Just boring, proven cryptography to keep everyday data safe.

Think of it like a house key: if you keep it safe, nobody else gets in. Lose it, and there’s no landlord with a master key. That’s the trade you choose for real privacy.

---

## Low-risk, low-cost, disposable by design

- **Small units, small blast radius.** Our apps are built from tiny pieces (messages, tickets, feedback packets) that stand alone. If one thing breaks, the rest keep working.
- **Built-in disposability.** Keys and links can be single-use or short-lived. Posters with a QR can open a pop-up mailbox for a weekend event, then vanish.
- **Cheap to run.** Servers store encrypted blobs and serve public pages. They don’t do surveillance or heavy personalization. This keeps costs—and temptations—low.

---

## Trust only when you need it

- **Most of the time, no trust layer.** Ask a question, leave feedback, buy a ticket—your key is enough.
- **When needed, add proofs.** For age-gated spaces or real-person checks, you attach a *verifiable credential* from someone you already trust (e.g., a certified age-check provider). We verify the signature; we don’t keep your personal details.
- **Reputation is portable and optional.** Some apps (like news/jobs) may show a track record for a key. Others don’t need it. Nothing is tied to a real-name account unless you choose.

---

## What this feels like (real examples)

- **ActualFeedback:** A shop prints a QR. You scan and send private feedback. They can act on it, or—if you allowed it—publish a snippet. No review wars, no data leak.
- **ActualTickets:** An indie venue issues 200 tickets. Your ticket is a signed pass bound to your key. No per-ticket fees, no overselling, no scalping chaos.
- **ActualDebates:** Arguments are claims + evidence, not dunks + likes. Observers mark “agreed,” “contested,” or “needs evidence” to build shared understanding.
- **ActualAnswers:** Ask. Answer. Cite. Readers tag answers as clear/unclear or supported/needs sources. Usefulness beats popularity.

Across all of them, there’s no account to make, nothing for us to mine, and nothing valuable for attackers to steal.

---

## Why this is safer for everyone

- **People:** No creepy profiles. No inbox full of “we lost your data” emails. Your key can even live in your password manager, wrapped with a passphrase.
- **Organisations:** Lower liability. If regulators or lawyers ask us for your content, we can’t hand it over—we never had it. You still get what you need: fair ticketing, real feedback, structured discussion.
- **The internet:** Fewer honeypots. Fewer incentives to extract and manipulate. More tools that do one job well without a hidden cost.

---

## What we *don’t* do

- We don’t run ads.
- We don’t sell or share behavioural data.
- We don’t pretend to “reset” your private key. (We *do* make backup and guardian options easy, if you want them.)
- We don’t do crypto-coins, tokens, or pay-to-play.

---

## The pitch to creators, organisers, and communities

- **Own your audience, not an account.** Your key is your channel across every Actual app. No platform tax, no lock-in.
- **Prove fairness, publicly.** Issue 500 tickets; show the world you issued 500 tickets. Publish aggregate feedback without exposing anyone.
- **Start small, grow clean.** Launch in a day. If it works, keep it. If not, burn it down—no data landfill left behind.

---

## Why now

People already understand “we can’t read your messages.” We’re extending that to *everything else you do online*. End-to-end **Data** encryption (e2eDe) makes safe defaults the norm, not a premium feature.

If you want a web that isn’t vulnerable by design—where even the operator can’t exploit you—this is how we build it: **keys, not accounts; crypto, not promises.**

Want to try it? Start with **ActualFeedback** or **ActualEvents**. Two minutes, no account, your key—done.


#### You:
### Strengths of the Pitch
Your pitch is already strong in several ways: It's concise, opinionated, and values-driven, which fits the civic-minded BBB vibe from our earlier discussions. It effectively contrasts problems (accounts, federation) with your solution (keys, E2EE/e2eDe), uses relatable analogies (house key), and grounds it in real examples from the tool ecosystem (e.g., ActualFeedback, ActualTickets). The "why now" section ties into growing privacy awareness, and the "what we don't do" clarifies boundaries. It's manifesto-like, emphasizing ethics over hype, which aligns with replacing toxic systems without ads/tracking.

However, based on common best practices for tech/product pitches (e.g., from sources like Forbes, MasterClass, and Slidebean), it could be more comprehensive. Pitches often include elements like market opportunity, team, monetization, and calls to action to make them actionable and persuasive. Drawing from our chats on crypto enhancements (e.g., passphrase-wrapped keys, guardians, visual QRs), there are opportunities to weave in practical details for usability and trust. Here's what feels missing or underdeveloped, grouped thematically, with suggestions.

### 1. **Market Opportunity and Validation**
   - **Missed**: No explicit market size, target audience, or evidence of demand. The pitch mentions "everyday apps" and British/western problems (scams, friction), but doesn't quantify (e.g., "X million UK consumers face Y in parking fines annually" from tools like Parking Ticket Triage). It also lacks "why this solves real pain" data or user stories.
   - **Why Add It**: Shows scale and relevance—pitches often include TAM/SAM (Total Addressable Market/Serviceable Available Market) to excite stakeholders. Ties back to your original brief: Focus on common UK issues like PCNs, rent hikes, or council tax (from the tool list).
   - **Suggestion**: Add a section like:
     > ## The Opportunity
     > Billions face daily friction from toxic systems: In the UK alone, 10M+ parking tickets issued yearly (many appealable), £X in hidden fees, and endless scams. Globally, data breaches hit 1B+ records in 2024. Actual tools replace this with civic alternatives—starting with low-friction MVPs like Subscrub (cancellations) and DepositShield (tenancy rights). Early betas show 80% user retention for key-based simplicity vs. account fatigue.

     Use web_search if needed for stats (e.g., UK parking ticket numbers).

### 2. **Business Model and Sustainability**
   - **Missed**: No mention of how it sustains (e.g., "a little [money] wouldn't hurt" from your brief). The pitch says "cheap to run" but doesn't explain revenue or funding—donations? Freemium? Org subscriptions? This leaves a gap on long-term viability.
   - **Why Add It**: Even non-profit/civic pitches need this to build credibility (e.g., Forbes notes "business model" as fundamental). Avoids the "how do you eat?" question.
   - **Suggestion**: Insert after "Low-risk, low-cost":
     > ## How We Sustain (Without Selling You Out)
     > - **Donations/Subscriptions**: Free for individuals; optional paid tiers for orgs (e.g., custom schemas in ActualFeedback, higher quotas in ActualJobs).
     > - **Civic Partnerships**: Grants from privacy orgs or integrations with ethical providers (e.g., verifiable credentials).
     > - **No Compromises**: Revenue never touches ads, data sales, or tracking—keeps servers lean at <£X/month per 10K users.

### 3. **Team, Roadmap, and Traction**
   - **Missed**: No team intro (who's building this?), roadmap (e.g., MVP launches for tools like ActualEvents or ActualNeighbours), or early traction (pilots, users, metrics). Pitches often highlight founders' expertise (e.g., your 5-year-old QR experiment) and milestones.
   - **Why Add It**: Builds trust—investors/partners want to know "who" and "how soon" (per SVB and MasterClass guides).
   - **Suggestion**: Add near the end:
     > ## Who's Building This + Next Steps
     > - **Team**: Founded by [Your Name/Background], with experience in crypto prototypes (e.g., visual key QRs in 2020). Collaborators from privacy tech and civic design.
     > - **Roadmap**: MVP launches Q4 2025: ActualFeedback (beta now), then ActualTickets/Debates. Open-source core crypto libs for audits.
     > - **Traction**: 500+ beta users in UK pilots; 70% report easier civic actions (e.g., refunds via FairRefund integration).

### 4. **Usability Challenges and Mitigations**
   - **Missed**: The pitch leans into "no resets" as a feature, but doesn't fully address barriers like key loss or non-tech users. From our recent chats, enhancements like passphrase-wrapped keys, guardians, and visual QRs aren't mentioned—key for making it "grandparent-proof" (as in ActualFamily).
   - **Why Add It**: Acknowledges realism; pitches should preempt objections (e.g., Figma examples include "risks"). Ties to your "disposable by design" ethos.
   - **Suggestion**: Expand "Your key, your rules":
     > - **Key Management Made Safe**: Wrap keys in passphrases (local unlock only); export as .key files, seed phrases, or visual QRs (encrypted to avoid leaks). Optional guardians (e.g., 2-of-3 trusted shares) for social recovery—user-controlled, no backdoors.
     > - **Handling Loss**: Keys are disposable; create new ones for low-risk actions. For orgs, delegation/rotation minimizes blast radius. Education via simple analogies: "Like a padlock—no spares, but backups you control."

### 5. **Competition and Differentiation**
   - **Missed**: Good contrast with accounts/federation, but could name-check alternatives (e.g., Signal for E2EE messaging, but not data; Mastodon for federation flaws; Google Forms for feedback, but with tracking). No "secret sauce" like crypto-as-policy or blockchain-adjacent feeds.
   - **Why Add It**: Sharpens uniqueness (Reddit threads emphasize this).
   - **Suggestion**: Enhance "Why federation isn’t the rescue":
     > - **Vs. Competitors**: Unlike Signal (messages only), we e2eDe all data (feedback, tickets). Vs. Nextdoor/Mastodon: No toxic incentives or single-server risks—our feeds are verifiable, tamper-evident logs without crypto hype.

### 6. **Call to Action and Engagement**
   - **Missed**: Ends abruptly—no invite to try, join, or contribute. Pitches need a hook (e.g., "Sign up for beta" or "Invest in civic tech").
   - **Why Add It**: Drives momentum (fi.co templates stress this).
   - **Suggestion**: Close with:
     > ## Join the Key Revolution
     > - **Try It**: Beta at actual.xyz—generate a key, test ActualFeedback.
     > - **Build With Us**: Open APIs for civic tools; contribute on GitHub.
     > - **Support**: Donate or partner to expand to more UK pains (e.g., NHS alerts via ActualNews integrations).

### Overall Recommendations
- **Structure Tweaks**: Make it slide-deck friendly (e.g., bullet-heavy, visuals for QRs/keys). Aim for 10-15 "slides" worth.
- **Length/Tone**: It's punchy—keep it, but add visuals (e.g., diagram of key flows) for engagement.
- **Validation**: If pitching to investors/partners, test with a small audience. For civic focus, emphasize "replacing bad systems" with tool examples (e.g., link Subscrub to account-friction pains).
- **Next Steps for You**: If you want, I can help revise a section (e.g., add the usability mitigations) or use tools to pull stats (e.g., web_search for "UK data breach stats 2024").

Amazing notes. Here’s a tighter, more *complete* pitch that keeps the manifesto vibe but adds the missing “business” bits—market, model, team/roadmap, usability, differentiation, and a clear call-to-action. Reading level: high-school friendly.

---

# Actual — keys, not accounts

**One line:** Actual makes everyday apps (news, jobs, feedback, tickets, debates, Q\&A) that run without accounts, ads, or tracking. You hold a key, not an account. Your data stays yours.

---

## The problem (and why the web feels gross)

- **Accounts leak power.** Email + password puts platforms in charge. They can watch, reset, ban, and sell. When they’re hacked, *you* bleed.
- **Federation isn’t a fix.** It’s still admins holding the keys. Many small single points of failure instead of one big one.
- **Dark patterns everywhere.** Cancellation mazes, junk fees, engagement traps. The business model rewards extraction, not service.

---

## The Actual way: e2eDe — end-to-end **Data** encryption

- **Your key is your identity.** No username. No “reset my password.” What you encrypt leaves your device locked to the people you choose—even we can’t read it.
- **Crypto = policy.** Whether something can ever be made public is decided by how it’s encrypted at the start, not by a switch we can flip later.
- **No cryptocurrency.** No coins, mining, or waste. Just standard cryptography used for good.

Think of it like a house key: keep it safe and nobody can impersonate you. Lose it, and there’s no landlord with a master key. That’s the point.

---

## Who this helps (and how big this is)

- **People:** Want to do basic things—give feedback, attend events, ask questions—without being profiled or paywalled.
- **Indie organisers & small orgs:** Want fair ticketing, honest feedback, and simple tools without handing their community to a platform.
- **Civic actors:** Councils, charities, community groups that need trust and privacy by default.

> The pain is huge and daily: hidden fees, appealable fines, bad cancellation flows, data leaks. We replace these with small, sharp tools that work.

---

## What it feels like (sample apps)

- **ActualFeedback:** Scan a QR in a shop → send private feedback safely. If you *choose*, a redacted snippet can be published—cryptographically controlled.
- **ActualTickets:** Indie venue issues 200 tickets. Your ticket is a signed pass bound to your key. No surprise fees. No secret overselling.
- **ActualDebates / ActualAnswers:** Claims + sources, not dunks + karma. Observers tag “agreed / contested / needs evidence” so common ground shows up.
- **ActualEvents / Neighbours:** Drop a beacon, meet locals, no surveillance.

---

## Built to be low-risk, low-cost, disposable

- **Small units.** Messages, tickets, feedback packets. If one breaks, the rest don’t.
- **Disposable by design.** Keys and links can be single-use or short-lived. Great for pop-ups, research, campus projects.
- **Cheap to run.** Servers store encrypted blobs and public pages. No ad-tech machinery, no profile warehouses.

---

## “But what if I lose my key?”

- **We’re honest:** there’s no reset. That’s why your key matters.
- **We help you succeed:** optional passphrase lock on your key; easy encrypted backups (.key file or QR); optional guardians (you pick two trusted people who can help you recover). *You* control recovery—never us.
- **For orgs:** delegation and rotation keep blast radius tiny. Lose a sub-key? Rotate it. Parent keys stay safe.

---

## Trust only when you need it

- **Most actions need no reputation.** Ask a question, leave feedback, buy a ticket—your key is enough.
- **When required, add proof.** Age-gated events or “real person” checks use *verifiable credentials* from approved issuers. We verify signatures; we don’t keep your personal details.
- **Optional reputation.** In higher-risk spaces (news/jobs/dating), keys can carry a track record. In low-risk tools, we keep it simple.

---

## Why we’re different (vs. the usual suspects)

- **Vs accounts & SSO:** No central login to reset, mine, or breach.
- **Vs federated servers:** No admin with master access to your stuff; fewer juicy targets for attackers.
- **Vs “free” platforms:** No ads, no tracking, no “growth hacks.” We ship tools, not slot machines.

---

## How we sustain this (without selling you out)

- **Free for people.** Use any Actual app without an account or payment.
- **Simple org pricing.** Organisers pay predictable fees for their keys/usage (e.g., ticket batches, higher feedback quotas). No per-ticket gouging, no “booking fees.”
- **Civic partnerships.** Grants and integrations with trusted providers (e.g., age-verification) when useful.
- **Never for sale:** no ads, no data brokerage, no dark patterns. Ever.

---

## Why now

People already accept “we can’t read your messages.” We’re extending that to *everything else*: feedback, tickets, debates, Q\&A. Safer defaults shouldn’t be a premium add-on—they should be the baseline.

---

## Who’s building this + what’s next

- **Team:** Better Britain Bureau—the same folks behind practical, pro-user tools like ActualNews/ActualJobs and the key-only prototypes we’ve discussed.
- **Roadmap (near-term):**
  1. Launch **ActualFeedback** and **ActualEvents** together (QR-first, no accounts).
  2. Add **ActualTickets** for indie organisers.
  3. Ship **ActualDebates/Answers** for structured discussion.
- **Openness:** Core libraries and specs are open for audit and re-use.

---

## Call to action

- **Organisers / indie venues:** Pilot ActualTickets + Feedback for your next event. Keep your crowd, cut the junk fees.
- **Shops, clinics, councils, campuses:** Put up a Feedback QR and get safer, better input in a week—not a quarter.
- **Civic builders & researchers:** Use our open components; plug them into your projects without asking for permission.

**Keys, not accounts. Crypto, not promises. A web that can’t exploit you—even if we wanted to.**
